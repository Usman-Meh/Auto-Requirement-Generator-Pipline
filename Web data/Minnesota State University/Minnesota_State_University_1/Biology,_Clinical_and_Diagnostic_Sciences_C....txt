Cytotechnology
Cytotechnology involves the microscopic study of cells for evidence of disease and cancer. Cytotechnologists are trained to accurately identify precancerous, malignant, and infectious conditions using cytological techniques. The “Pap test” (an evaluation of cells from the uterine cervix) is the best known test in this field. The four-year curriculum consists of three years spent at the university completing the required courses and the fourth year is a 32 credit internship spent in professional education. Agencies participating in the cytotechnology program include, but are not limited to: Mayo School of Health Sciences in Rochester, MN. Admission into the fourth year hospital clinical internship is competitive. Therefore, admission to the program does not ensure placement into the fourth year internship. The degree is awarded by the university after successful completion of the internship year. Graduates are then eligible to take the certifying examination.
