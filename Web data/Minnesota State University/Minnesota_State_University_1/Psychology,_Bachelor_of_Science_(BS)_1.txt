Psychology (BS)
Psychology is the scientific study of the effects of individual, social, physiological, developmental, and environmental factors on thoughts, feelings, and behavior.Â  Psychology courses cover the methods of psychological inquiry and the findings of psychological research.
Students study psychology because they wish to prepare for a professional career as a psychologist or social scientist, because they are planning a career in which the understanding of human behavior is important, or simply because they wish to develop a greater understanding of themselves and others. The practice of psychology at the professional level requires a graduate degree beyond the bachelor's degree.
