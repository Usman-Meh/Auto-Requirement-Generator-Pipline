Gender and Women's Studies (MA)
The MA is recommended for students planning to pursue further graduate study beyond the master's degree and for careers in nonprofits, activism, and advocacy. Gender and Women's Studies is an interdisciplinary field examining the social construction of gender and sexuality and the intersections of all forms of oppression. The program examines feminist theory and activism and helps students develop skills to bridge the two.
