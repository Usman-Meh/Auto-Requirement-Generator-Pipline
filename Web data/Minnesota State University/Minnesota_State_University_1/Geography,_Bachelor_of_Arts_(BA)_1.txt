Geography (BA)
The Geography BA degree allows students to examine the relationships between people and the environment, while enabling them to focus more fully on the cultural aspects of the discipline. Students pursuing the major can take a variety of regional courses to enhance their knowledge of world affairs and also become proficient in a language of their choice. Systematic courses in economic, social, urban and rural geographies can broaden their understanding of human spatial systems. Students learn to apply geospatial technologies to solve real-world problems related to topics such as migration, health and economic development. The major enables students to choose a complementary minor in another discipline that enhances their specific interest areas. The major provides the background to enable students to enter careers in the public and private sectors, as well as prepare them for graduate study.
