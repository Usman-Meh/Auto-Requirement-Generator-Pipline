Gender and Women's Studies (MS)
The MS is recommended for students planning social justice careers. The program prepares students for careers in non-profits, activism, and advocacy, or for further graduate study. Gender and Women's Studies is an interdisciplinary field examining the social construction of gender and sexuality and the intersections of all forms of oppression. The graduate program examines feminist theory and activism and helps students develop skills to bridge the two.
