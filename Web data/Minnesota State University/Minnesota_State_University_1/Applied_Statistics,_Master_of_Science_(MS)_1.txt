Bayesian Statistics is an alternative to Frequentist statistics. Bayesian inference uses probability for both hypotheses and data. In Bayesian statistics, population parameters are considered random variables having probability distributions. The probabilities measure a degree of belief in the parameters. BayesÂ¿ theorem is used to reformulate the beliefs using observed data. This course introduces the Bayesian approach to statistical inference and describes effective approaches to Bayesian modeling and computation.

Available software will be used to complete the data analysis projects with a balance between theory and applications.
