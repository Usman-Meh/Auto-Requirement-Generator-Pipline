Geographic Information Science (CERT)
The Undergraduate Certificate in Geographic Information Science (GISc) integrates technologies such as Remote Sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), various associated techniques, and programing. The program introduces foundational concepts and basic principles of geospatial information collection, management, and analysis. The certificate ensures that students have sufficient theoretical understanding of geospatial science, and are able to apply the techniques to analyze real world issues. The project-based approach and hands-on activities that heavily utilizes ArcGIS and ERDAS Imagine software provide necessary skills to be successful in this field. The certificate program offered by the Department of Geography provides background and training that enable students to enter careers in the public or private sectors, and to prepare them for graduate study in geospatial sciences.

GIS Practicum
1-4 credits
This offering will include supervised project work in raster-based and/or vector-based GIS, using problems and data drawn from local or regional agencies or other professional-level organizations with whom the Geography Department maintains a relationship. Students must have completed one of the prerequisite courses, or a course or professional-level experience.
Prerequisites:
Prerequisite: GEOG 373, or 473/573, or permission of instructor.
GEOG 481
GIS and Environmental Hazards
3 credits
This course teaches students to reconstruct past landscapes and identify environmental hazards related to historical land use using GIS and remote sensing software. Applications include the identification of hazardous waste sites, wetland drainage, bluff erosion and other environmental hazards relevant to local history research, environmental consulting, archaeology, resource management, real estate, planning and civil engineering. Students will learn to use and interpret historical air photos and maps, digital imagery and LiDAR in problem-solving contexts and to report research findings in effective written, graphic and verbal presentation formats used by government agencies and private consulting firms.
Prerequisites:
GEOG 373
GEOG 482
GIS for Natural Resources
4 credits
This course provides students as well as natural resource professionals the opportunity to develop knowledge of natural resources management based on GIS science. Detailed examples and discussions of GIS operations and analyses associated with managing natural resources are provided. Weekly labs and the final project will focus on various GIS applications in this field. For example, integrating GIS and remote sensing techniques for sustainable land development, conservation biology, forest, water, wetland, wildlife, and agriculture management. Students will also learn how to combine GIS concepts with GIS software skills and apply them to real-world natural resources management tasks.
Prerequisites:
GEOG 373
