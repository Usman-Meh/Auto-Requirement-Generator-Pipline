Geography (MS)
The Geography MS provides students an applied learning environment with emphasis on high-impact research and learning experiences. Geography students gain expertise in natural and/or human systems that can be applied to solving real-world problems; quantitative and qualitative field and laboratory methods; geospatial technologies (GIS, GPS, GNSS, Remote Sensing); conducting scientific inquiry; and communicating scientific results/data to the public. Students are trained to be successful in public and private sectors, or continue to a Ph.D. program.
Two options are available: 1) a 30-credit coursework and research thesis option; or 2) a 34-credit coursework and Alternate Plan Paper (APP) option.Â Students who complete the Geography MS are competitive for an applied professional career or admission to nationally recognized doctoral degree programs.
