Core
CIS 121
Introduction to Programming
4 credits
This course provides conceptual and logical tools for students planning to major in a computing-based major. Programming in a high-level language such as C++, Python, or Java, and the development of skills in abstraction, problem-solving, and algorithmic thinking are emphasized.
Prerequisites:
MATH 112 or MATH 113 or MATH 115 or MATH 121
CIS 122
Data Structures
4 credits
This course is a continuation of CIS 121. Students develop a basic knowledge of programming skills and object-oriented concepts, and use fundamental data structures such as lists, stacks, queues, and trees.
Prerequisites:
CIS 121. Select One Course: MATH 112, MATH 113, MATH 115, MATH 121, or MATH 130
CIS 223
Algorithms
4 credits
This course builds on CS 122 (Data Structures) with coverage of advanced data structures and associated algorithms, including trees, graphs, hashing, searching, priority queues, and memory management. Formal proof techniques, the analysis of best, worst, and expected cases, and the development of efficient algorithms are emphasized. Use of effect-free programming, first-class functions, and higher-order operations such as map, reduce, and filter are explored.
Prerequisites:
MATH 121 and CS 111 or CIS 122 or IT 214
CIS 380
Systems Analysis and Design
4 credits
This course explores both structured as well as object oriented systems analysis and design. Use of upper and lower CASE tools are employed in the analysis, design and implementation of a team oriented term project.
Prerequisites:
CIS 340. Select One Course: CIS 122 or CIS 123
