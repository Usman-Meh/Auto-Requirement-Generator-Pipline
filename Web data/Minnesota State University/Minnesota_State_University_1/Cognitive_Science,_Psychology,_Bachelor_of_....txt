Psychology
Cognitive Science is an interdisciplinary inquiry concerned with understanding the nature and development of such intelligent capacities as perception, language, reasoning, learning and problem-solving, whether these capacities are realized in biological or artificial systems. The psychology emphasis uses a psychological lens for understanding cognition supported by the fields of biology, philosophy and computer science.
