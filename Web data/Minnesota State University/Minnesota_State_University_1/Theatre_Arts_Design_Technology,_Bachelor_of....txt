Theatre Arts (BFA)
Design/Technology
Designed for creative artists both in performance and in production, and provides training for increased professional competencies in the specialized areas of theatre performance and design. This is a highly specialized degree path and provides intensive training in the art and craft of theatre making. The department offers a comprehensive curriculum designed to balance students' practical training with historical and socio-political context to prepare them as creative and scholarly practitioners in the performing arts. Students' ability to think critically and act globally equips them with the necessary knowledge and skills to enter professional lives as performers, choreographers, technicians, designers, arts administrators, arts advocates, and leaders in the arts. As a result, students emerge from the program with greater global, historical, racial, cultural, gender, and justice literacy in their fields. BFA students receive accelerated training in their area of specialization. Students are required to participate in realized projects within their area of specialty and specificity in the classes they are required to take. The BFA program produces highly trained specialists in one area of theatre (acting, musical theatre, or an area of design).
