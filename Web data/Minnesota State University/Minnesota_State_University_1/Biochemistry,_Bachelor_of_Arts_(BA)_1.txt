The BiochemistryBAÂ  is designed to give students a strong foundation in biology, chemistry and biochemistry. The curriculum is augmented with liberal arts courses to add a broader perspective and give greater versatility to graduates. Students are well prepared to pursue advanced study in professional health care programs. Many of our students pursue advanced degrees in medical schools, physician assistant programs, pharmacy schools and dental schools. Students graduating are well prepared to pursue laboratory positions in health care or agri-business companies or sales/customer service positions at pharmaceutical or medical device companies.
