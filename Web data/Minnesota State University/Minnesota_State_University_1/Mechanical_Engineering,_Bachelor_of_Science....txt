Required General Education
Required Special General Education (23 credits)
The Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering degree does not adhere to the standard general education program required by other majors.

Courses may be chosen to satisfy the university cultural diversity requirement concurrently.
Required Goal Area Courses. Each student should discuss with their academic advisor on the selection of courses to meet this requirement early in their academic career. Specifically, the minimum requirements consist of at least 6 credits from Goal Areas 2, 5, or 6, excluding CHEM 191, CHEM 201, and ENG 271W; and at least 6 credits from Goal Areas, 7, 8, 9, or 10 excluding ENVR 101, in addition to the Required General Education courses.
