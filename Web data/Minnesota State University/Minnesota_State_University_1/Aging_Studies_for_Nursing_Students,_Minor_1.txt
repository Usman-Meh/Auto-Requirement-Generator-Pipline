Aging Studies for Nursing Students Minor
The Minor in Aging Studies for Nursing Students provides undergraduate nursing students with the opportunity to explore the biological, psychological and social perspectives on aging while enhancing their specific knowledge of nursing in relation to older persons. Within the next two decades elders over the age of 65 will comprise 25% of the population in the United States leading to a shortage of over one million nurses to serve the aging population, making this minor particularly beneficial in supporting this career choice for nursing students. The University is a member of the Association for Gerontology in Higher Education.
