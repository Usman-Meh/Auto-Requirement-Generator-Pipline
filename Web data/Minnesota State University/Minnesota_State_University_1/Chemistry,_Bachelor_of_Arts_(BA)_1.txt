Chemistry (BA)
The Chemistry BA is designed to give students a strong foundation in each sub-discipline of chemistry. This curriculum is augmented with more liberal arts courses to add a broader perspective to the baccalaureate and give greater versatility to the graduate. The Chemistry BA, coupled with other coursework, is a strong pathway to professional health care programs. Many of our graduates pursue advanced degrees in Medical Schools, Physician Assistant Programs, Pharmacy Schools and Dental Schools. Students graduating with a BA in chemistry are also well prepared to pursue laboratory positions or sales/customer service positions at pharmaceutical or medical device companies.
