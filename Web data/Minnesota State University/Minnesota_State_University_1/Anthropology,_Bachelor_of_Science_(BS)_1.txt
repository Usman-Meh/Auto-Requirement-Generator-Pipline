Anthropology (BS)
Anthropology is the study of the origins and diversity of human biology and culture. Anthropologists study the evolution and adaptations of the human species through the four major subdivisions of the discipline: archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and cultural anthropology. The major provides training in all areas of anthropology for the liberal arts major with an interest in global awareness, cultural diversity, human evolution and adaptation, prehistory, and an understanding of human behavior. Application of the discipline in real-world scenarios is stressed.
