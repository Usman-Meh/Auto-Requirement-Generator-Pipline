Engineering Management (PSM)
The program is designed to prepare students with the scientific and technical training necessary to advance and excel in industry, while simultaneously developing highly valued business skills. The program is characterized by the "manufacturing-plus" curricula, combining rigorous graduate study in manufacturing with coursework in management, communication, and other professional skills that are in high demand. The program focuses on written and verbal communication skills, leadership, and team-building required in professional settings. Instead of a thesis, a collaborative research project is required. The program is recognized by the Commission on Affiliation of Professional Science Master's Programs (PSM Commission).
