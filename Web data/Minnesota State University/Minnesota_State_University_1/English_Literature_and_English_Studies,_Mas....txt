The MA degree in Literature and English Studies is a fully online program, ideal for working adults. In practical terms, this means that all 600-level core courses and seminars for the program are currently offered online. Because we believe that live discussion of literary texts is an important component of graduate-level education, many of our online classes incorporate synchronous virtual meetings. Scheduled times for such meetings will be listed with the course information. Contact specific instructors with questions about expectations for synchronous courses.
