Environmental Geology (CERT)
The Environmental Geology Certificate is designed to develop a core component of skills in geology that are relevant to solving environmental problems. This certificate will complement students of any major who are interested in pursuing employment in environmental science or resource management job sectors. Courses within the certificate place an emphasis on understanding and solving problems associated with our regional geologic environment.

Major Common Core
GEOL 121
Physical Geology
4 credits
Physical geology is the study of how the earth works. From mountain building to soil erosion, this course provides an introduction to all the main areas of geologic study. Lecture discussions and laboratory exercises are designed for students seeking a major or minor in one of the natural sciences.
Prerequisites:
none
Goal Areas: GE-03, GE-10
GEOL 201
Elements of Mineralogy
4 credits
Examination of the elemental composition and crystal structure of various common minerals. Laboratory time is spent practicing techniques of identifying crystals and minerals. The importance and occurrence of many economic minerals is also covered thoroughly in this course.
Prerequisites:
GEOL 100 or GEOL 107 or GEOL 121
GEOL 320W
Sedimentology and Stratigraphy
4 credits
Focused studies of the origins and processes of transportation, deposition, burial, and diagenesis of sedimentary materials. Lab assignments focus on sedimentary material identification and analysis. Field trips required.
Prerequisites:
Select one course: GEOL 100, GEOL 107, GEOL 121
Required Environmental Geology
- Choose 3 - 4 Credit(s).
GEOL 449
Applied Soil Science and Surface Hydrology
4 credits
The application of geologic data and principles to problems created by human occupancy and use of the physical environment. Lecture and laboratory topics include soil classification and conservation, hazardous waste site evaluation and remediation, and living with geologic hazards.
Prerequisites:
GEOL 100 GEOL 104 or GEOL 107 or GEOL 121
GEOL 450
Hydrogeology
3 credits
This course introduces physical and chemical studies of hydrogeology. The main areas of discussion will include the physical and chemical attributes of aquifers, movement of ground-water and solute through soils and rocks, and reactions between earth materials and pollutants in ground-water systems. The class includes extensive use of MODFLOW and MT3D, the two most commonly usedgroundwater modeling programs currently available.
Prerequisites:
