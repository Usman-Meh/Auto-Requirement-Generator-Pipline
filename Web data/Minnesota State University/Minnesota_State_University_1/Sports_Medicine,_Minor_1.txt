Sports Medicine is intended for students who are interested in the broad field of Sports Medicine. While available to any student, it is ideal for students pursuing healthcare-related fields or study in the following academic disciplines: pre-athletic training, pre-physical therapy, pre-medicine, pre-chiropractic, exercise science, physical education, coaching, psychology, nutrition, and nursing. The minor provides students with foundational knowledge in concepts of fitness, first aid, prevention and care of athletic-related injuries and illnesses, and therapeutic interventions and rehabilitation. The goal is to provide interested students, from a variety of backgrounds with the academic background and the opportunity to further develop interest in Sports Medicine related topics and issues.

Introduction Course
- Students must choose 1 option. Exercise Science majors must choose option 2.
Option 1
HP 170
Introduction to Sports Medicine
2 credits
This course will introduce the field of sports medicine and healthcare careers involved in sports medicine (e.g., athletic trainer, orthopedic surgeon, sports physical therapist, sports orthotist, registered sports dietician, sports medicine physician, certified sport psychologist, licensed psychologist, sports strength and conditioning coach) and will familiarize students with majors and minors that can lead to a career in sports medicine. Students will become familiar with issues that span healthcare professions such as cultural competence, ethics, professionalism, credentialing, patient centered care and interprofessional care delivery. And students will be introduced to resources on campus that can help them accomplish their educational goals.
Prerequisites:
none
Option 2
- For Exercise Science Majors
HP 260
Introduction to Exercise Science & Practitioner-based Professions
3 credits
This course will introduce exercise science and practitioner-based professions (e.g., athletic trainer, biomechanist, chiropractor, exercise physiologist, medical doctor, occupational therapist, personal trainer, physical therapist, physician's assistant, podiatrist, registered dietician, sport psychologist, strength coach). It will acquaint students with opportunities within related majors, minors, and an overview of exercise science and practitioner-based career options. Academic planning for undergraduate programs, in addition to strategies for gaining admission to exercise science and practitioner-based graduate studies programs, will be included.
Prerequisites:
none
Pathomechanics
- Students must choose 1 option. Exercise Science majors must choose option 2.
Option 1
HP 328
Pathomechanics in Sports Medicine
3 credits
This course will prepare students to identify pathomechanics in physically active people. Pathomechanics are motions leading to injury. Students will understand the foundational concepts of biomechanics and kinesiology, including the origin, insertion, action, and innervation of muscles and how to identify kinetic and kinematic forces that may result in injury during physical activity. Students will then apply this knowledge in an analysis of motion to identify potentially injury causing mechanics.
Prerequisites:
none
Option 2
- For Exercise Science Majors
