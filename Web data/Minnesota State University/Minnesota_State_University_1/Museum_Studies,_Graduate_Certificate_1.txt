Museum Studies (GC)
The aim of this program is to provide a perspective on the theory and practice of museums in an expanding global environment of technological, social and political change for current and future museum professionals. It emphasizes the role of technology as a pervasive aspect in today's museum, examines new models of education, exhibition, and business strategies, and explores the role of the museum as an agent of social change. We welcome students interested in all types of museums including history, technology, science, art, special topic or themed museums, historic sites, national parks and zoos and those interested in exhibitions for corporations, government agencies and private organizations.
