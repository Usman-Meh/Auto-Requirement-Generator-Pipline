Advising
Athletic Training (MS)
This program will prepare graduate students to enter the health care field of athletic training. Athletic Trainers (ATs) are health care professionals who collaborate with physicians, and other health care professionals to provide services that include injury/illness prevention, emergency care, clinical diagnosis, therapeutic intervention and rehabilitation of injuries and medical conditions sustained or exacerbated by participation in athletics and other physical activity. ATs work under the direction of physicians, as prescribed by state regulatory statutes. ATs are highly qualified, multi-skilled health care professionals, who fall under the allied health professions category as defined by Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Athletic trainers are assigned National Provider Identifier (NPI) numbers, and the taxonomy code for athletic trainers is 2255A2300X. Athletic trainers are listed in the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the “professional and related occupations” section along with other mid-level health care professionals.
