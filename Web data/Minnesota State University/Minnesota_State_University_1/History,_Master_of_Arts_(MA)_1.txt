History (MA)
The History MA provides regional access to high-quality, post-graduate education at a reasonable cost. Our students benefit from personal mentorship and training that connects their current abilities to their dreams of pursuing an advanced degree (such as the Ph.D.). They develop the skills (research, writing, analysis, and critical thinking) that prepare them for producing original scholarship. Additionally, we help support student research projects and participation in conferences financially, which, in turn, enables students to hone their skills as practicing historians and create experiences that are valued when applying for Ph.D. programs.
