The Business Law minor provides students a solid foundation of business law and the skills to be successful professionals who make ethical, strategic and legally-savvy decisions. The 18 credit minor includes four required courses that cover a wide array of core legal concepts including the legal system, litigation, contracts, sales, and employment law. Students complete their minor with two additional courses that are tailored to their specific interests and fields such as negotiations and conflict management, construction and design law, technology and intellectual property law, and international law. The program also regularly offers study abroad courses in international law and politics. The Business Law minor is a perfect fit for students who plan to go to law or graduate school.
