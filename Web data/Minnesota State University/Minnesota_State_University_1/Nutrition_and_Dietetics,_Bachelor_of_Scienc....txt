Nutrition and Dietetics (BS)
The Professional Program in Dietetics is a comprehensive Future Educational Model (FEM) program. Students apply to the professional program after completing pre-requisite foundational courses in chemistry, anatomy, physiology, microbiology, nutrition, sociology, ethnic studies, and other related fields. The three-year professional program is an accelerated combined degree program where students begin graduate courses during the final year of their undergraduate program.
Upon completing the requirements for the Nutrition BS and the Dietetics MS, including all Supervised Experiential Learning hours, a student graduates with a Dietetics MS, receives a Verification Statement, and is eligible to sit for the national registration exam for dietitians.  Starting in 2024, a master’s degree and a Dietetics Verification Statement are required to take the exam. Successful completion of the exam allows the student to become a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN).

The Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics is designed to fulfill the requirements for a student going on to complete the Master of Science in Dietetics at Minnesota State University as part of a transitional master’s degree. Completion of the Bachelor’s degree without subsequent completion of the Master’s in Dietetics would not lead to eligibility for taking the national registration exam to become a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN). Students wishing to complete the Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics alone should meet with their faculty advisor in the Department for advising specific to their career goals. Students coming to Minnesota State University as transfer, change of major or with a previous degree should meet with the Dietetics Program Director for careful planning of their academic pathway here and any consideration of Prior Learning Credit.
