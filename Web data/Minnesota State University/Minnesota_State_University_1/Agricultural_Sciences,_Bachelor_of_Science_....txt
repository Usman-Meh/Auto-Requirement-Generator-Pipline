Agricultural Sciences (BS)
Agricultural Sciences includes the study of soil management, and crop and animal production; the science is a combination of ecology, biology, chemistry, and genetics, and seeks to understand plant and animal nutrition and crop and animal production. Students prepare for careers related to agriculture as they learn soil physical and chemical characteristics and effects of agriculture on soil fertility. They study other factors of production including climate, weeds, fungi, erosion, leaching, and pests. Students also learn about plant physiology, genetics, nutrition, effects on soil, satellite-based micro-management of inputs and the maximization of sustained yield, and how to market farm products.
