HVAC&R Engineering Design (CERT)
This certificate provides a focused study of the latest technology and procedures for the design of heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and refrigeration (HVAC&R) systems and equipment. The required coursework emphasizes theoretical design as well as industry relevant skills and procedures. Prepares students to be highly competitive in the job market and to eventually take the Principles and Practice of Engineering (PE) Examination in Mechanical â€“ HVAC and Refrigeration.
The certificate may not be eligible for federal financial aid. Speak with the
