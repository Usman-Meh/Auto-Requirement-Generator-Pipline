Art Teaching (BS)
Art Education is devoted to the training of qualified and motivated artists who are also Kindergarten through high school educators. We are also devoted to the development of concepts, attitudes, and skills in the visual arts within a broad university curriculum of liberal arts orientation. There are four objectives: professional training of artists and scholars in chosen areas of specialization, preparation of art educators, elective study for students in all areas of the university, and service to the local communities as a source of cultural enrichment.
