Audiology is the study of both hearing and balance. In this course we will learn about the anatomy and physiology of the hearing and balance systems, common changes in hearing and balance, how we assess our hearing and balance systems, how we interpret and present the results to the patient and discuss management options for hearing and balance. In addition to the procedures, we will discuss how to provide person-centered care for each step.
