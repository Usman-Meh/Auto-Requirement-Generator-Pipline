Theatre Arts (BS)
The Theatre Arts BS is designed for theatre practitioners who want a general, well rounded competency in all areas of theatre performance and production. It is identical to the BA degree in Theatre except that the BA requires 8 credits of a foreign language and the BS does not.  The department offers a comprehensive curriculum designed to balance students' practical training with historical and socio-political context to prepare them as creative and scholarly practitioners in the performing arts. Students’ ability to think critically and act globally equips them with the necessary knowledge and skills to enter professional lives as performers, choreographers, technicians, designers, arts administrators, arts advocates, and leaders in the arts. As a result, they emerge from the program with greater global, historical, racial, cultural, gender, and justice literacy in their fields.
