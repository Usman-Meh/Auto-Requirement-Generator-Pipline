Music (BA)
Evidence of Music can be traced back to the earliest records of human existence and it is more than a career, it is a passion. Whether seeking a career on the stage, in the box office, or in entertainment law, the Bachelor of Arts allows students to customize an experience that fits their current and future goals.Â  While students will learn all of the fundamentals and be fluent in the musical world, they will also have enough flexibility to add a minor in any field, study languages, or pursue electives in complimentary areas.
