Computer Science
Cognitive Science is an interdisciplinary inquiry concerned with understanding the nature and development of such intelligent capacities as perception, language, reasoning, learning and problem-solving, whether these capacities are realized in biological or artificial systems. The computer science emphasis uses a computational lens for understanding cognition supported by the fields of psychology, philosophy and biology.
