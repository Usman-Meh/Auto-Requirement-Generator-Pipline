Ethnic and Multi-Cultural Studies (MS)
The Master of Science in Ethnic and Multicultural Studies Degree Program started in fall semester 2002. The goal at the graduate level is to prepare students to take on higher levels of responsibility in the work force than is possible with a Baccalaureate Degree. The requirements for completion of the M.S. Degre are: 1) pass course work with a minimum of a B grade average; 2) pass a comprehensive examination and 3) writing requirements, for example, a Thesis Plan or 4) with an Alternate Plan Paper.
The program emphasizes a diversity of theories on race and ethnicity, and research methods. for example, Ethnic Studies 401/501: Applied Cultural Research or Ethnic Studies 402W/502: Ethnic Research Methods/Skills. These courses expose students to qualitative, quantiative and evaluation research methods; and computer software technologies such as Qualtrics.
Minnesota State University-Mankato is one of very few universities with this specialty in the Midwest region, and the only university in the Upper Midwest that offers a Master of Science in the field. In summary, the program continues to lead in this academic discipline through the dissemination of academic knowledge that considers the historical and contemporary dynamics on race and ethnic relations in national and internal contexts.
