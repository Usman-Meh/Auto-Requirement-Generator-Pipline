The Sexuality Studies minor is an interdisciplinary course of study designed to complement any major. The objective of the curriculum is to develop a critical framework for understanding social justice by examining how sexual practices, expressions, identities, and representations are shaped by social, anthropological, historical, psychological, legal, sociological, and political contexts. Under the coordination of the Department of Gender and Women's Studies, the minor focuses on issues of social ethics and sexuality, including the impact of cultural inequality on sexual well-being and sexual health.
