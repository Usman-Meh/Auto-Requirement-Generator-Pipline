                                    Requirements
Major Common Core
Take either GEOG 315 or GEOG 415 and GEOG 410
GEOG 315
Geomorphology
4 credits
This course explores the scientific study of earth's surface, through investigating landscapes and landforms, their characteristics, origin and evolution, and the biologic, chemical, and physical processes that create these landscapes and landforms through time. Fundamental linkages between process and form and climate/climate change, earth materials, geologic structures, plate tectonics, and biological systems will be examined. Implications of anthropogenic influences on processes and modification of earth's surface will also be assessed. Laboratory exercises and field trips are required.
Prerequisites:
none
GEOG 410
Climatic Environments
3 credits
The characteristics of particular climates and understanding the factors that control their spatial distribution.
Prerequisites:
none
GEOG 415
Earth Surface Processes
4 credits
This course examines the natural processes that operate on our planet and shape the landscape presently. This will be done through a focus on applied exercises, measurements and direct/indirect observations. Through applied projects students will have an understanding of how these processes interact within a variety of Earth Systems.
Prerequisites:
none
Major Restricted Electives
Choose 4 Credit(s).
GEOG 411
Soils Geomorphology
4 credits
This course examines the dynamic nature of soils including the processes that control formation and degradation, anthropogenic impacts, spatial distribution across landscapes, and links among soils and other components of the earth system. A combination of lectures and hands-on exercises in field and laboratory settings are utilized to explore the complex interactions between soils and landscapes.
Prerequisites:
none
GEOG 416W
Fluvial Geomorphology and Hydrology
4 credits
An in-depth investigation into fluvial systems including sediment transport, sediment budget analysis, channel geometry/morphology, drainage basin analysis, geomorphic evolution of fluvial landscapes, hydrology (i.e., runoff generation and channel formation, storm hydrograph and flood analysis, discharge measurements) of fluvial systems, and effects of anthropogenic modification and use of fluvial systems. Registration with completed prereqs or instructor consent.
Prerequisites:
Either Geog 101 or Geol 121 and Geog 315 or 415 are recommended. Or instructor consent.
Major Unrestricted Electives
Choose 6 Credit(s). * Choose courses from two of the three listed departments *GEOG 411 and GEOG 416 can be taken as an unrestricted elective if they were not taken as a restricted elective.
ANTH 331
Environmental Anthropology
4 credits
This course focuses on studying the diversity of human societies using environmental approaches such as evolutionary/ecological perspectives and systems modeling. Case studies will be drawn from Native American cultures.
Prerequisites:
none
GEOG 411
Soils Geomorphology
4 credits
This course examines the dynamic nature of soils including the processes that control formation and degradation, anthropogenic impacts, spatial distribution across landscapes, and links among soils and other components of the earth system. A combination of lectures and hands-on exercises in field and laboratory settings are utilized to explore the complex interactions between soils and landscapes.
Prerequisites:
none
GEOG 416W
Fluvial Geomorphology and Hydrology

Registration with completed prereqs or instructor consent.
Prerequisites:
Either Geog 101 or Geol 121 and Geog 315 or 415 are recommended. Or instructor consent.
GEOG 440
Field Studies
1-4 credits
Various excursions to study physical and cultural landscapes inside and outside of Minnesota.
Prerequisites:
none
GEOL 201
Elements of Mineralogy
4 credits
Examination of the elemental composition and crystal structure of various common minerals. Laboratory time is spent practicing techniques of identifying crystals and minerals. The importance and occurrence of many economic minerals is also covered thoroughly in this course.
Prerequisites:
GEOL 100 or GEOL 107 or GEOL 121
GEOL 320W
Sedimentology and Stratigraphy
4 credits
Focused studies of the origins and processes of transportation, deposition, burial, and diagenesis of sedimentary materials. Lab assignments focus on sedimentary material identification and analysis. Field trips required.
Prerequisites:
Select one course: GEOL 100, GEOL 107, GEOL 121Initial deposit: N/A
