Geographic Information Science (GISc)
The Geographic Information Science (MS GISc) program provides a cost-effective educational option for in-state, out-of-state, and international students who are seeking a higher degree in GISc. We strive to meet the growing demand for higher-level academic preparation for GISc in geography and related disciplines. Our MS GISc program offers comprehensive courses on geographic information systems, remote sensing, GPS, spatial analysis, geospatial modeling and simulation, geodatabase, programming, web mapping, transportation analysis, and more. In addition to core courses, students also can take elective courses related to their area of interest. Students will be able to enhance their geospatial technological skills and the ability to deploy such technologies to a variety of real-world problems. The thesis, APP, and coursework-only options will allow students to complete their degrees in a flexible way.
