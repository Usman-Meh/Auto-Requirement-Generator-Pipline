Why pursue the NPL Graduate Certificate?
The program provides knowledge and skills that help students become competent and competitive in the nonprofit sector. Students engage in service learning that connects coursework to real-world settings, and are required to complete a supervised internship with a nonprofit organization.
Nationally, as of 2012 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, Feb 2016), nonprofit employment constituted 70% of the educational services sector, 46% of healthcare and social assistance, and 15% of arts, entertainment, and recreation.
In Minnesota, as of 2012 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, Feb 2016), over 14% of employment was attributed to the nonprofit sector. (And yes, you can earn a salary – with benefits – at a nonprofit!)
With planning, the program can be completed online, and students on or near campus can select from a greater number of courses that are part of the program.

What Students are Saying:
“After graduating Minnesota State University, Mankato, in the summer of 2017, I was constantly looking for ways to enhance my vision as an entrepreneur, community organizer, and a transformational speaker for young POC (person of color) women. I thought what better way to increase my knowledge about nonprofits and effective leadership skills than to apply for a graduate level certificate.”
