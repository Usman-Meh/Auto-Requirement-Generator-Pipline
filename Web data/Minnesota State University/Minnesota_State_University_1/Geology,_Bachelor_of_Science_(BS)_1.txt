Geology (BS)
Geology is the study of the Earth, its materials, and its processes. Geologists use this knowledge to solve scientific problems for the benefit of society. Topics of interest include but are not limited to soil preservation, water production and quality, hazards mitigation, resource exploration and production, engineering of structures large and small, climate change, the history of life on Earth, and the search for life on other planets.
Training in Geology requires knowledge of fundamental sciences (chemistry, math, and physics) combined with Geology coursework that applies these sciences to the study of Earthâ€™s composition, processes, and structure. Geology training emphasizes the characterization of earth materials (minerals, rocks, sediment, soil, and water) with techniques ranging from visual description to cutting-edge laboratory analysis. Geology students may also take mapping coursework such as Geographic Information Systems to better understand spatial relationships and earth processes. Upper-division Geology coursework focuses on applying a wide range of approaches to scientific and societally-important problems in the complex and dynamic environments that characterize our planet.
Students are prepared for entry-level employment in the environmental consulting sector, or in positions related to natural resource protection. Entry-level employment in the energy- and mineral-resource job sectors is also attainable with a Geology degree.
A student is eligible to pursue a Professional Geologist (PG) license, which provides additional opportunities for career advancement and enhanced earning potential, particularly in the environmental consulting job sector. Students interested in obtaining a PG are strongly encouraged to take the Fundamentals of Geology (FG) exam near the time they compete their degree. Completion of the Geology B.S. in combination with passing of the FG exam advances an individual to Geologist in Training (GIT) status. Following 5-years of Geology-related work experience, the GIT is qualified to take the Practice of Geology exam and become a fully licensed PG.
Professional Geology licensure in Minnesota is administered by its Board of Architecture, Engineering, Land Surveying, Landscape Architecture, Geoscience, and Interior Design (AELSLAGID) at
http://mn.gov/aelslagid/geology.html
. For info on licensure procedures in other states, please see the American Institute of Professional Geologists webpage:
http://www.aipg.org/certificationboards
Graduate study in Geology or closely related discipline (e.g., Environmental Science, Water Resources) may be pursued following completion of a B.S. degree. Students who wish to pursue graduate study in Geology should consult with an advisor.
