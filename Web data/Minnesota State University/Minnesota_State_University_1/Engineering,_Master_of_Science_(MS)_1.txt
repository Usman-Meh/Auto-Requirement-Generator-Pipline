Engineering (MS)
The engineering programs offer a Master of Science in Engineering (MS) degree with specializations in either Mechanical or Electrical Engineering. The MSE for Mechanical Engineering carries forward the philosophy of our undergraduate program and is devoted to producing application-oriented mechanical engineers. Our program is built to provide students with experiences and opportunities for growth.
The Mechanical Engineering program is designed to serve the following constituencies:
New engineering graduates who want to increase their depth of knowledge before entry into the engineering workforce.
Engineers in business and industry who want to continue their formal engineering education at the postgraduate level.
Engineering graduates interested in research or pursuing a future doctorate.
Students pursuing a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Mechanical Engineering and who also plan on completing the MSE degree at MSU may apply for the Combined Degree Program. This option allows students to take classes that will count toward their MSE prior to completing the BS. Students may register for up to 12 credits in approved courses that will count toward both the BS and MS degrees.

At least 50% of the coursework must be at the 600-level, excluding Capstone credits. At least 50% of the coursework must be in the mechanical engineering discipline, excluding Capstone credits.
Capstone Course
To satisfy the various needs of our students and industry, the program has three Engineering capstone options available:
Thesis Option - 32-credit program with 3-6 credits devoted to thesis research. The option is ideal for students wanting to gain more research exposure.
Alternate Plan Paper - 34 credits with 1-2 credits devoted to the preparation of an alternate plan paper. The option is ideal for students intending to enter or return to the engineering workforce.
Design Option - 32-credit program with 3-6 credit devoted to a formal design project. The design project is comparable in scope to a research thesis. The option is ideal for students who have been or are currently in the engineering workforce.Initial deposit: N/A
