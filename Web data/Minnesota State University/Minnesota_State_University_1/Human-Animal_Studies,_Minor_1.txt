Human-Animal Studies is an interdisciplinary field that investigates the diverse ways the lives of human and non-human animals intersect. This minor investigates animals themselves, past and present relationships between human and nonhuman animals, and different perspectives on incorporating other animals into human society. This minor is ideal for anyone who is passionate about other animals.  It is also a wonderful minor for students who plan to work in animal-related fields, such as agriculture, shelters or animal assisted therapies, the veterinary sciences, and more.
