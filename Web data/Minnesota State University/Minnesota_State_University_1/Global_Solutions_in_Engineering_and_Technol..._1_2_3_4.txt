Summary
Global experiences are difficult to fit into a traditional engineering program because of credit expectations and sequential course offerings. This minor in the context of engineering experiences and with a focus on cultural learning will create a pathway for students to develop cultural and language skills desired by our regional employers. Through the resulting minor, graduates will be produced with an expanded set of skills to address global problem solving in engineering and technology.
