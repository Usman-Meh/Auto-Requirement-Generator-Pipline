Philosophy
The philosophy concentration for the Cognitive Science program aims to challenge students to think critically, while providing a framework of various schools of thought that have led to the prominent theories of today. Students can expect to discuss questions regarding human perception, thought, intentionality, truth, etc, in order to better understand human connections, individually and socially. Where is the line between perception and reality? Are our minds separate from our bodies? Students who complete the Philosophy concentration of the Cognitive Science program can go on to careers or graduate programs in any of the 4 respective areas. Philosophy students will be especially proficient in the ethical studies regarding the cognitive science field, along with the legal implications of new technologies.
