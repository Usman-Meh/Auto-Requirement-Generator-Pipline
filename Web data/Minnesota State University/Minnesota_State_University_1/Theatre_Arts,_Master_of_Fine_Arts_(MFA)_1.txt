Theatre and Dance (MFA)
The MFA is a terminal degree for the creative artists and educators, and provides training for increased professional competencies in the specialized areas of Theatre and Dance. The department offers a comprehensive curriculum designed to balance students' practical training with historical and socio-political context to prepare them as creative and scholarly practitioners in the performing arts. Students’ ability to think critically and act globally equips them with the necessary knowledge and skills to enter professional lives as performers, choreographers, technicians, designers, educators, arts administrators, arts advocates, and leaders in the arts.  As a result, they emerge from the program with greater global, historical, racial, cultural, gender, and justice literacy in their fields.
