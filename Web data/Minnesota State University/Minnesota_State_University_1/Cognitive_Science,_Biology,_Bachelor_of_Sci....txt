Biology
The biology concentration allows students to acquire a thorough background of human anatomy and physiology, along with providing a biomechanical framework of the respective bodily functions. In learning about the systems of the human body, students are given a physical reference to other concepts being taught in the program. This will help in the understanding of physical manifestations of psychological problems for instance, or in creating the electrical circuits for prosthetic limbs. The biology concentration course load will allow students to explore a deeper understanding of the human body and brain at a molecular level, along with more advanced laboratory procedures. The connection between the body and mind is a pivotal link to accomplishing the many goals in the field of Cognitive Science today. For example, using fMRI technology to map neuron pathways in the human brain, or the ability to restore hearing by way of cochlear implants. These successes are made possible because of the cohesiveness between many different branches of science. Biologists, Programmers, Electrical Engineers, Neurologists, and Psychologists are few of the many different groups of individuals who had to take part in creating the positive leaps of science given in the example above.
