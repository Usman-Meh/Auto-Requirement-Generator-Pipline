Environmental Science (BS)
Environmental Science is an interdisciplinary field directed towards understanding natural environmental processes, human interactions with the environment, and ultimately finding equitable and sustainable solutions to environmental problems. Major areas of focus include terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity, soils, climate change, pollutants, and environmental regulations with an emphasis on experiential learning through field coursework, research and/or internships. The major is orientated towards helping students develop skills for leadership positions in federal, state, and local governments, conservation groups, consulting firms, and industry. The program is also ideal as a foundation for advanced study in law, policy, and scientific research specialties.
