Geographic Information Science (GC)
The goal of the program is to educate students in Remote Sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS), geovisualization, geoanalytics, geospatial modeling, and various associated sciences. The program provides students the skills necessary to investigate spatio-temporal patterns that result from human-environmental interactions. Emphasis is on vector and raster based models in Geography, Social Sciences, Business, Physical and Environmental Sciences, Health, Engineering, Recreation, and Resource Management.  It is designed for students who want to acquire or advance their knowledge in the field of geospatial sciences, and for professionals who need these skills for their current careers. The primary objective of the certificate program is to provide necessary exposure to geospatial data, concepts, methods, tools, models, and programing knowledge so that students can evaluate geospatial issues and construct appropriate plans of action. The certificate provides background and training to enable students to enter careers in the public or private sectors, and to prepare them for higher study in geospatial sciences.
