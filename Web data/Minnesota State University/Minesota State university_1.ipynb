      "Anthropology is the study of the interaction of human biology and culture. Anthropologists study the human species through the four subdivisions of the discipline: archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and cultural anthropology. The major provides training in all areas of anthropology for the liberal arts major with an interest in global awareness, cultural diversity, human adaptation, and an understanding of human behavior. Application of the discipline in real-world scenarios is stressed. Students pursuing the BA take a language series and are prepared to pursue anthropology and its application with a more global outlook.\n",
