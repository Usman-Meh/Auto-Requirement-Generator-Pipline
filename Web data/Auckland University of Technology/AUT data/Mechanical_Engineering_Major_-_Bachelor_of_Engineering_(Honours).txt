Courses Menu In this section Home Mechanical Engineering - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Mechanical Engineering Major - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Study the Mechanical Engineering major in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)
Develop a broad base of engineering skills and prepare yourself for a wide range of engineering careers
Mechanical engineers work with advanced technology across many fields – from transportation to energy systems, home appliances to robotics, manufacturing machinery and processes to medical technologies
In a world where global warming and environmental degradation are critical issues, mechanical engineers play a key role in developing new sustainable technologies
This mechanical engineering degree focuses on analytical and design skills, and you have the opportunity to apply these skills in an industry project
This is part of the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)

You also need to complete 800 hours of planned, supervised work experience to graduate, in addition to completing all your courses
This experience exposes you to common engineering industry practices and helps you gain knowledge of engineering procedures, engineering responsibilities, and health and safety practices
If you started in 2024 or are starting in 2025 You’ll explore areas like mechanical design, mechatronics and control, manufacturing technologies, and thermodynamics and heat transfer
Most of your first-year courses are shared between the majors in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and the Bachelor of Engineering Technology, making it easy for you to switch between our engineering degrees and majors*
If you’re already studying at AUT and have any questions about the courses you should enrol in, email engineer@aut.ac.nz *Cross-credits between different engineering majors and degrees are assessed on a case-by-case basis, and you may not be able to gain cross-credits for all your first-year courses
