Start your university studies with our Diploma in Computer and Information Sciences, become familiar with computing subjects and prepare yourself for further study
The Diploma in Computer and Information Sciences is a great choice if you’re not sure what to expect from uni or from studying computing, or missed out on getting into your dream degree
You’ll take the same courses as our first-year bachelor’s degree students, and become familiar with different computing subjects in a supportive environment with additional academic and student support
Once you’ve completed your diploma you can then move into Year 2 of the Bachelor of Computer and Information Sciences, which means you can still complete your chosen bachelor’s degree in three years
