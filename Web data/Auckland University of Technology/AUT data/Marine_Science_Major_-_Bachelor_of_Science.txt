Courses Menu In this section Home Marine Science Marine Science Major - Bachelor of Science Love the ocean and marine life? The Marine Science major in the Bachelor of Science explores the science of the ocean
You'll study the physics, chemistry, geology and biology of the oceanic environment to predict and solve complex global challenges
With 71 percent of Earth’s surface covered by water, the oceanic environment is critical to our existence
It regulates climate, mediates temperature and drives the weather, determining rainfall, droughts, and floods
Our oceans are the world’s largest store of carbon; they act as a carbon sink and absorb heat from the atmosphere
More than 90% of the excess heat generated as a result of climate change and about 30% of the carbon dioxide produced by humans since the start of the industrial revolution have ended up in our oceans
Study marine science and find out why and how our oceans are changing, what that means for the future of our biosphere, and how you can make a difference
