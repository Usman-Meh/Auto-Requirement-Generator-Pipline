Courses Menu In this section Home Civil Construction Engineering Major - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Civil Construction Engineering Major - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Study the Civil Construction Engineering major in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degree and learn to build quality structures that enhance our living and working environments
Designing safe, cost effective and environmentally sustainable buildings and infrastructure is essential to our society
Professional civil engineers and construction engineers are involved with the design, planning and construction of the physical infrastructure that surrounds us
Whether the project is high-density housing or commercial construction, these engineers design reliable processes and build quality structures
AUT’s civil construction engineering programme will help you develop skills for these highly rewarding careers
This is part of the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)

You also need to complete 800 hours of planned, supervised work experience to graduate, in addition to completing all your courses
This experience exposes you to common engineering industry practices and helps you gain knowledge of engineering procedures, engineering responsibilities, and health and safety practices
If you started in 2024 or are starting in 2025 You’ll become familiar with construction management, structural engineering, materials technologies, building information modelling, construction systems, productivity improvement and waste reduction strategies
Most of your first-year courses are shared between the majors in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and the Bachelor of Engineering Technology, making it easy for you to switch between our engineering degrees and majors*
If you’re already studying at AUT and have any questions about the courses you should enrol in, email engineer@aut.ac.nz *Cross-credits between different engineering majors and degrees are assessed on a case-by-case basis, and you may not be able to gain cross-credits for all your first-year courses
