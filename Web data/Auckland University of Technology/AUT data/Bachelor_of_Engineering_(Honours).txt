Consider starting with: Certificate in Science and Technology Diploma in Engineering If you’re studying the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours), you’ll learn to design creative solutions for complex engineering problems, design for sustainability, and solve problems creatively and ethically
You also need to complete 800 hours of planned, supervised work experience to graduate, in addition to completing all your courses
If you started in 2024 or are starting in 2025 To prepare for your future career as an engineer, you’ll develop strong interpersonal and teamwork skills, and apply what you’ve learnt through engineering projects and other practical courses
Each year you study courses related to your chosen major (the main subject you want to specialise in) and develop an understanding of the wider field of engineering
If you're a full-time student, you normally study eight courses a year (120 points each year, and 480 points for the entire degree)
Refer to the web page for your chosen major for the courses you’ll study each year
Year 1 Your first year introduces you to the different fields of engineering and helps you better imagine what your future career as an engineer could look like
Many of your first-year courses are shared between the majors in this programme and the Bachelor of Engineering Technology, making it possible for you to switch between our engineering degrees and majors.* *Cross-credits between different engineering majors and degrees are assessed on a case-by-case basis, and you may not be able to gain cross-credits for all your first-year courses
Year 2, 3 and 4 You become more specialised in your chosen major and also develop more advanced engineering skills to prepare for your future career
Maritime engineering students move to Tasmania for Year 3 and 4
In Year 4 you complete an industry-based project, working on a piece of engineering design and analysis for organisations like Mighty River Power, Fletcher Building, BECA, SKM, Genesis Energy, Contact Energy, Fisher & Paykel Appliances, Spark or Auckland Airport
If you started before 2024 If you started your studies in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) before 2024, the courses you need to complete are a little different
