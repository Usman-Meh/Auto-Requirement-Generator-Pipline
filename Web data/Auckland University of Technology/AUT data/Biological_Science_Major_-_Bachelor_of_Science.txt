Courses Menu In this section Home Biological Science Biological Science Major - Bachelor of Science Study the Biological Science major in the Bachelor of Science, and become familiar with microbiology, biodiversity, cells and molecular biology, gene technology, and the ecological and evolutionary processes that drive biological variation
Biology is at the heart of life on Earth, from the smallest microorganisms to entire ecosystems
In recent years, there have been remarkable discoveries in the biological sciences, from antibiotics and vaccines to disease-resistant crops and alternative fuels
The Biological Science major is ideal for students who are interested in understanding the science of life, how everyday existence can be explained and how human activities can shape Earth’s future
In the face of climate change and population growth, the biological sciences have never been more important and there are many rewarding careers for biological science graduates
