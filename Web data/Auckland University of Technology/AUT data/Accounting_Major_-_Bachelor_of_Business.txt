Accounting is a dynamic career, delivering multifaceted business analysis, and contributing to the strategic development of business, public sector and not-for-profit organisations
Accountants must be excellent communicators and strongly analytical, as well as having the required technical skills specific to the vocation
They must relate to people from all walks of life, as they’re frequently called upon to explain concepts and strategies to those outside the financial sphere
The changing nature of accounting software packages means that accountants need to have well-developed technical skills
These broad-based skills mean that accounting graduates can start successful careers in a huge variety of roles
