Courses Menu In this section Home Economics Economics Major - Bachelor of Arts Economics is vital to both the social sciences and public policy
This major develops and applies concepts and frameworks that are essential for understanding and addressing critical economic and social issues
Economics is about choice; the choices people, companies and governments make every day – from how we respond to price changes to how governments address issues like growing income inequality or climate change
In a world with increasingly scarce resources these decisions are crucial
That’s why economists are highly sought after in both the private and public sector
Not open to new students from 2025
If you want to study economics as part of your Bachelor of Arts, you could include it as a second major or a minor in economics
