Consider starting with: Certificate in Science and Technology Diploma in Engineering As a Bachelor of Engineering Technology student, you learn to make engineering judgements, solve problems creatively and ethically, and design for sustainability
You develop strong interpersonal and teamwork skills; setting you up well for your future career as an engineering technologist
You also need to complete a minimum of 600 hours of planned supervised work experience to graduate, in addition to completing all your courses
If you started in 2024 or are starting in 2025 Each year you study courses related to your chosen major (the main subject you want to specialise in) and develop an understanding of the wider field of engineering
If you're a full-time student, you normally study eight courses a year (120 points each year, and 360 points for the entire degree)
Refer to the page for your chosen major for the courses you’ll study each year
Year 1 Your first year introduces you to the different fields of engineering and helps you better imagine what your future career as an engineer could look like
Many of your first-year courses are shared between the majors in this programme and the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours), making it possible for you to switch between our engineering degrees and majors.* *Cross-credits between different engineering majors and degrees are assessed on a case-by-case basis, and you may not be able to gain cross-credits for all your first-year courses
Year 2 and 3 You become more specialised in your chosen major and also develop more advanced engineering skills to prepare for your future career
In Year 3 you also complete valuable workplace experience, working on an industry-based project related to your major
If you started before 2024 If you started your studies in the Bachelor of Engineering Technology before 2024, the courses you need to complete are a little different
Find out what courses you need to take to complete your qualification if you started in 2023 or earlier
