Courses Menu In this section Home Architectural Engineering Architectural Engineering Major - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Study the Architectural Engineering major in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degree and develop the skills to engineer for high-quality buildings
Businesses, tenants and homeowners expect more from the buildings they work and live in
They want buildings that are energy efficient and more sustainable, comfortable to live and work in, offer more services and are fit for purpose, now and in the future
Architectural engineers help make this happen
The Architectural Engineering major covers the skills you need to develop complex designs that can meet all those needs, from the foundations to the services
This is part of the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)

You also need to complete 800 hours of planned, supervised work experience to graduate, in addition to completing all your courses
This experience exposes you to common engineering industry practices and helps you gain knowledge of engineering procedures, engineering responsibilities, and health and safety practices
If you started in 2024 or are starting in 2025 You’ll become familiar with sustainable built environment and passive design strategies, building modelling and performance simulation, architectural management techniques and building research applications
Most of your first-year courses are shared between the majors in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and the Bachelor of Engineering Technology, making it easy for you to switch between our engineering degrees and majors*
If you’re already studying at AUT and have any questions about the courses you should enrol in, email engineer@aut.ac.nz *Cross-credits between different engineering majors and degrees are assessed on a case-by-case basis, and you may not be able to gain cross-credits for all your first-year courses
