Consider starting with our: Certificate in Applied Science Certificate in Science and Technology You can build your degree in a way that suits you and your interests, and include subjects from outside of science as part of your studies
To graduate with a Bachelor of Science you need to complete: Core courses (120 points) All Bachelor of Science students need to complete core courses that help you develop transferable skills and support your work in all other courses in the degree
Year 1 Choose one of: DIGD507 Mahitahi | Collaborative Practices SCIE504 Science and Society And choose one natural sciences course ASTR500 Introductory Astronomy BIOL500 Foundations of Life BMED500 Introduction to Biomedical Science CHEM500 Chemistry in Our World CHEM501 Principles of Chemistry CHEM502 Biological and Solution Chemistry CONS500 Biodiversity EASC500 Our Dynamic Earth ENVS502 Environmental Science Skills ENVS503 Our Total Environment FOOD502 Food Science FOOD503 Food Technology GESC500 Mapping Our Environment HEAL505 Human Anatomy and Physiology HEAL507 Health and Environment MAOH501 Hauora Māori and Environment MASC500 Introduction to Marine Science MASC501 Marine Science Techniques MELS501 Histology and Cytology MICR501 Microbial Life PHYS501 Physics for Scientists and Engineers SOSC585 Climate Action And one mathematical and computer sciences course COMP500 Programming Concepts and Techniques* COMP503 Object Oriented Programming* MATH502 Algebra and Discrete Mathematics MATH504 Introductory Mathematics for Science MATH505 Algebra and Calculus I STAT500 Applied Statistics STAT502 Introductory Probability and Statistics *Only available to students in the Analytics and Mathematical Modelling and Computation majors And one course from either the natural sciences or mathematical and computer science courses above
Year 2 Complete the following course: SCIE606 Vision Mātauranga: Science Practice in Aotearoa And one of: CHEM604 Instrumental Analysis SCIE600 Scientific Inquiry Year 3 - Final-year project In Year 3, you complete a project in an area related to your major
This project gives you an important competitive edge for your career, and is good preparation for postgraduate study
Courses you complete for this project: SCIE707 Science Capstone Project A SCIE708 Science Capstone Project B These courses give you a basic understanding of different areas of science, and help you decide which subject to focus on later in your studies
One of the core courses is the capstone project, a research or industry project you complete in your third year
Your chosen major (120 points) Your major is the subject area you want to specialise in
This makes up one third of your degree, and usually consists of eight courses related to your chosen subject
You can view the list of majors in this degree in the ‘Majors’ tab
Flexible component (120 points) You can choose one of the following options Two minors (60 points each); or A minor (60 points) and elective courses (60 points); or A second major (120 points) Your second major, minor(s) and elective courses can be from different AUT degrees; they don’t need to be from science
