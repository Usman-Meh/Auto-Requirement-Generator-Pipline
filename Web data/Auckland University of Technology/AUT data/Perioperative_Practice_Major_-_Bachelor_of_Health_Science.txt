This includes anaesthetic care, surgical care and post-anaesthetic care
When a patient needs an operation there are times when they are required to be unconscious
There are other times when a patient would like to be fully aware, just not in pain
Both of these scenarios are examples of requiring anaesthetic care
Surgical care is the care provided during the surgical procedure by the whole operating theatre team to ensure the patient is well cared for during a time of vulnerability
Post-anaesthetic care, is the immediate time after the surgical operation, whereby the patient recovers or wakes up from their anaesthetic
Throughout this journey, the patient requires a team of highly skilled and knowledgeable health professionals
Anaesthetic technicians are one of these health professions, and they work alongside doctors and nurses to deliver these high standards of anaesthetic and perioperative care
Responsibilities of an anaesthetic technician Supporting anaesthetists in providing high standards of anaesthetic care, including airway management Working alongside the anaesthetist to place patients' breathing tubes and intravenous lines, including placement of Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters Working alongside the anaesthetist to administer anaesthetics, including local anaesthetics and nerve blocks Monitoring patients’ vital signs (such as heartbeat) while under anaesthesia Checking and setting up life support and anaesthetic machines Delivering high standards of patient care after surgical operations Where you could work District Health Boards (DHBs) Private hospital organisations There are excellent career progression opportunities for anaesthetic technicians, including moving into management, education or advanced clinical roles such as resuscitation teams
Professional registration As a graduate of the Bachelor of Health Science in Perioperative Practice, you’ll be eligible to apply for registration with the Medical Sciences Council of New Zealand, and on registration will have the protected title of registered anaesthetic technician
Fantastic employment opportunities Anaesthetic technicians are a valued role within the operating theatre
With a Bachelor of Health Science in Perioperative Practice you’ll be highly employable nationally
Starting salaries for anaesthetic technicians range from approximately $51,000 to $80,000, commensurate with experience
