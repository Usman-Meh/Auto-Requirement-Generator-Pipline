Courses Menu In this section Home Maritime Engineering - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Maritime Engineering Majors - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Through a joint venture with Australian Maritime College (AMC), New Zealand students can now study maritime engineering in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) degree
If you study maritime engineering, you start with two years of study at AUT and then transfer to the AMC in Tasmania for your final two years
You then specialise in marine and offshore engineering, naval architecture or ocean engineering
There is no other programme of this kind in New Zealand
Maritime majors are only open to New Zealand citizens
Students are subject to Australian visa and fee requirements depending on their citizenship and residency status
New Zealand citizens are entitled to study in Australia on the same basis as Australian permanent residents
Most New Zealand citizens are eligible for student loans through StudyLink but you should check your eligibility with StudyLink

A minimum of 12 weeks of planned supervised work placement is required prior to graduation on top of successful completion of all your courses
This experience exposes you to common engineering industry practices and helps you gain knowledge of engineering procedures, engineering responsibilities, and health and safety practices
If you started in 2024 or are starting in 2025 You’ll become familiar with sophisticated maritime engineering and technology
Most of your first-year courses are shared between the majors in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and the Bachelor of Engineering Technology, making it easy for you to switch between our engineering degrees and majors*
If you’re already studying at AUT and have any questions about the courses you should enrol in, email engineer@aut.ac.nz *Cross-credits between different engineering majors and degrees are assessed on a case-by-case basis, and you may not be able to gain cross-credits for all your first-year courses

Year 4 Apart from the industry-based research project, you learn integrated process, applied control and maritime engineering design
Naval Architecture Year 3 Your study focuses on structural analysis, ship resistance, ship design and underwater vehicle technology
Year 4 Apart from courses on advanced ship structures and computational fluid dynamics, your focus will be on an industry-based research project
Ocean Engineering Year 3 You study aquaculture, concrete structures, deep water and finite element analysis
Year 4 Covers coastal and subsea engineering as well as design of offshore structures
You also undertake an industry-based research project this year
If you started before 2024 If you started your studies in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) before 2024, you find information on the final courses you need to complete on the UTAS website
