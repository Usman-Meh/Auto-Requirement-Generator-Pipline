BOOK A SESSION This is part of the Bachelor of Engineering Technology
Brochure Enquire How to apply Apply now Download programme guides Engineering, Computer & Mathematical Sciences (2024) Engineering, Computer & Maths (2025) What you study Career opportunities Related programmes As a mechanical engineering student, you’ll develop the skills to maintain, develop and design different aspects of modern mechanical technology
You also need to complete a minimum of 600 hours of planned supervised work placement to graduate
This experience exposes you to common engineering industry practices and helps you gain knowledge of engineering procedures, engineering responsibilities, and health and safety practices
If you started in 2024 or are starting in 2025 To prepare you for your engineering career, there’s a strong focus on sustainability and the skills to work in multi-disciplinary teams
Most of your first-year courses are shared with the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours), making it easy for you to switch between our engineering degrees
If you’re already studying at AUT and have any questions about the courses you should enrol in, email engineer@aut.ac.nz *Cross-credits between different engineering majors and degrees are assessed on a case-by-case basis, and you may not be able to gain cross-credits for all your first-year courses

VIEW STUDY PLANNERS Specialisation project All students need to complete an industry-based project in their third year, which is completed over two semesters
This supervised project helps you develop new skills which include theoretical/practical design and production techniques
Students work as individuals or as part of a team on projects related to their major
During the project, you critically reflect on the relationship between your academic studies and engineering workplace practice, test theories and identify gaps in your knowledge to enhance your understanding of practical engineering matters
