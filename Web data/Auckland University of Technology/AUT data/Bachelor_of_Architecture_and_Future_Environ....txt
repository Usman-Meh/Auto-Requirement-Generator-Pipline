A minor is smaller than a major
It usually consists of four courses
Creative Technologies is a minor we would recommend but you can also choose from a wide range of other minors from across AUT
View minors you can study To become a registered architect, you need a three-year bachelor’s degree, a two-year Master of Architecture (Professional) and two years (3,300 hours) of professional practice under the supervision of a registered practising architect
Successful completion of the Bachelor of Architecture and Future Environments will enable students to apply for entry into the Master of Architecture (Professional), which is designed to meet the competency requirements for professional registration as an architect in New Zealand and Australia
Students who choose not to proceed to the Master of Architecture (Professional) can go into a range of other creative and design-based industries, related professions, public service organisations or other postgraduate studies
