This major covers the theory and practical skills to prepare you for a career in this exciting field
This is a highly interdisciplinary degree and there's cross-over with disciplines like visual art, textiles, industrial design and others
Our secret is to start with human experience - how spaces feel and function, and what they mean to people
You'll think about details like surface, colour, pattern, connection, and consider how materials and light can be used creatively to give spaces a particular character, and how things change over time
Year 1 You’ll be introduced to essential spatial and interior design concepts and processes, and will focus on intimate spaces, exploring how we experience and perceive the things close to us
You’ll analyse familiar spaces from new perspectives, explore materials, develop your drawing and digital modelling skills, and work with materials, light, surfaces and time to create atmosphere

The year ends in a public exhibition to place your work in the public eye
