Courses Menu In this section Home Software Engineering - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Study Software Engineering - Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) Through the Software Engineering major in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) you develop cutting-edge skills for your future engineering career
Professional software engineers are responsible for constructing, deploying and maintaining high-quality software in a systematic, timely and disciplined manner
Software engineers must be technically proficient and work effectively in teams and with multiple stakeholders
You learn to design, develop, test and maintain software
To prepare you for a career as a professional engineer you also develop your communication and teamwork skills
This is part of the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)

You also need to complete 800 hours of planned, supervised work experience to graduate, in addition to completing all your courses
This experience exposes you to common engineering industry practices and helps you gain knowledge of engineering procedures, engineering responsibilities, and health and safety practices
If you started in 2024 or are starting in 2025 You’ll explore mathematics and computational techniques, data structures and algorithms, software theory and construction, data and process modelling, interface design and engineering management
Most of your first-year courses are shared between the majors in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and the Bachelor of Engineering Technology, making it easy for you to switch between our engineering degrees and majors*
If you’re already studying at AUT and have any questions about the courses you should enrol in, email engineer@aut.ac.nz *Cross-credits between different engineering majors and degrees are assessed on a case-by-case basis, and you may not be able to gain cross-credits for all your first-year courses
