Courses Menu In this section Home Food Science Study Food Science - Bachelor of Science The Food Science major in the Bachelor of Science introduces you to the science behind the food we eat
It can open the door to a wide range of careers in food science
Food innovation is driven by trends like reducing sugar, sodium and fat; using more natural flavourings and colourings, and improving the shelf-life of foods
Food scientists are critical in the production of food
They develop new food products, improve sensory attributes and nutritional content of foods, and find new ways to preserve, process, package and distribute food
Study food science and become familiar with food chemistry, food microbiology, sensory science, food product development and food processing and technology
You learn to analyse the characteristics of food, discover new food sources, and research how to make processed foods safe and healthy
