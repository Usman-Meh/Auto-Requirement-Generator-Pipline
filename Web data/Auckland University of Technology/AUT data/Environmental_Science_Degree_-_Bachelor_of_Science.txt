Courses Menu In this section Home Environmental Science Environmental Science Degree - Bachelor of Science Study the Environmental Science major in the Bachelor of Science and become an environmental problem solver, with an in-depth understanding of the science that supports healthy water, air, soils and ecosystems
The Environmental Science major will immerse you in the science of environmental problem solving
Our courses are designed to give you a well-rounded degree, and cover environmental science concepts, scientific data interpretation and communication, and environmental management and policy
There's an emphasis on essential ‘hands-on’ skills, with multiple field trips and practical lab sessions each year
As an environmental science student, you explore the ‘total environment’ and become familiar with the scientific principles to investigate, understand and manage ecosystems - and where and how humans fit in
This understanding is essential to protect Aotearoa New Zealand’s unique natural environment, and is an excellent foundation for many rewarding careers
