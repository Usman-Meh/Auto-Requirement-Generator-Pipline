Study Menu In this section Home Study Study options Study engineering, computer and mathematical sciences Courses Master of Engineering Master of Engineering Discover the latest developments in the field of engineering and research a topic of your interest with the Master of Engineering
Complete either a thesis or a research project in engineering
The Master of Engineering is designed to help you develop your research skills and enhance your knowledge in the field of engineering
There are two pathways: Research (includes a thesis), or Coursework (includes a research project)
We’re proud to be home to a number of internationally renowned research institutes and centres, and many of our students complete their research project in collaboration with these well-known research entities
AUT's expertise in engineering ranges from telecommunications to materials and manufacturing technologies, and from industrial optimisation to engines and vehicles
