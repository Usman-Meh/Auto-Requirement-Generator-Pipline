Courses Menu In this section Home Chemistry Study Chemistry - Bachelor of Science Study the Chemistry major in the Bachelor of Science and explore environmental, biological, organic, physical, inorganic, food and analytical chemistry
Developing new products and processes, and experimenting with the make-up and behaviour of different chemicals are some of the challenges chemistry graduates get to take on
A degree in chemistry opens the door to a wide range of career options, both in and out of the laboratory
You gain essential practical laboratory skills needed to be successful in scientific employment – here and overseas
AUT chemistry graduates have careers in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, petrochemicals, toiletries, plastics and polymers
There are also opportunities in the food and drink industry, health and medical organisations and scientific research organisations
