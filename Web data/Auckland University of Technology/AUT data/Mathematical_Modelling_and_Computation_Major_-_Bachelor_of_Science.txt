Courses Menu In this section Home Mathematical Modelling and Computation Mathematical Modelling and Computation Major - Bachelor of Science The Mathematical Modelling and Computation major in the Bachelor of Science will give you the skills to carry out modelling research and the analysis of problems in many industries and organisations
Mathematical modelling tells us about our world and helps predict what will happen next
Whether you want to look at global warming patterns, figure out the structural integrity of a building or forecast economic trends – it all relies on mathematical modelling
With skills in mathematical modelling and computation you can be part of the solution to a vast array of complex issues facing the world

You’ll also be able to use data to validate the models you’ve created
You'll develop the statistical skills and mathematical techniques required for mathematical modelling
In your third year, you can choose from courses that focus on mathematical modelling in science, or on business and financial applications
You'll have to opportunity to practise your skills in a final-year project
Apart from the courses below you also need to complete courses from your second major, your chosen minor(s) or electives
Core courses All Bachelor of Science students need to complete core courses that help you develop transferable skills and support your work in all other courses in the degree
Year 1 Choose one of: DIGD507 Mahitahi | Collaborative Practices SCIE504 Science and Society And choose one natural sciences course ASTR500 Introductory Astronomy BIOL500 Foundations of Life BMED500 Introduction to Biomedical Science CHEM500 Chemistry in Our World CHEM501 Principles of Chemistry CHEM502 Biological and Solution Chemistry CONS500 Biodiversity EASC500 Our Dynamic Earth ENVS502 Environmental Science Skills ENVS503 Our Total Environment FOOD502 Food Science FOOD503 Food Technology GESC500 Mapping Our Environment HEAL505 Human Anatomy and Physiology HEAL507 Health and Environment MAOH501 Hauora Māori and Environment MASC500 Introduction to Marine Science MASC501 Marine Science Techniques MELS501 Histology and Cytology MICR501 Microbial Life PHYS501 Physics for Scientists and Engineers SOSC585 Climate Action And one mathematical and computer sciences course COMP500 Programming Concepts and Techniques* COMP503 Object Oriented Programming* MATH502 Algebra and Discrete Mathematics MATH504 Introductory Mathematics for Science MATH505 Algebra and Calculus I STAT500 Applied Statistics STAT502 Introductory Probability and Statistics *Only available to students in the Analytics and Mathematical Modelling and Computation majors And one course from either the natural sciences or mathematical and computer science courses above
Year 2 Complete the following course: SCIE606 Vision Mātauranga: Science Practice in Aotearoa And one of: CHEM604 Instrumental Analysis SCIE600 Scientific Inquiry Year 3 - Final-year project In Year 3, you complete a project in an area related to your major
This project gives you an important competitive edge for your career, and is good preparation for postgraduate study
Courses you complete for this project: SCIE707 Science Capstone Project A SCIE708 Science Capstone Project B Mathematical modelling and computation courses If you're majoring in mathematical modelling and computation, this is the main subject area you specialise in
It makes up one third of your degree and consists of eight mathematics-related courses you study throughout your degree
Year 1 courses MATH505 Algebra and Calculus I STAT502 Introductory Probability and Statistics Year 2 courses MATH605 Algebra and Calculus II MATH606 Modelling and Differential Equations I MATH607 Quantitative Decision Analysis Year 3 courses MATH707 Mathematical Computation MATH708 Modelling and Differential Equations II And one of: MATH700 Financial Modelling and Computation MATH709 Mathematical Modelling in Health and Biology Build your degree Use our online tool to build your own degree and see what your three years of study could look like
