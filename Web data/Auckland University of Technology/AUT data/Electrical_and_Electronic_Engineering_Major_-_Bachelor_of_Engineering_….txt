You also need to complete 800 hours of planned, supervised work experience to graduate, in addition to completing all your courses
This experience exposes you to common engineering industry practices and helps you gain knowledge of engineering procedures, engineering responsibilities, and health and safety practices
If you started in 2024 or are starting in 2025 You’ll become familiar with large scale electric power flow, automated production systems, complex hardware and software systems, telecommunications and embedded digital systems
Most of your first-year courses are shared between the majors in the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and the Bachelor of Engineering Technology, making it easy for you to switch between our engineering degrees and majors*
If you’re already studying at AUT and have any questions about the courses you should enrol in, email engineer@aut.ac.nz *Cross-credits between different engineering majors and degrees are assessed on a case-by-case basis, and you may not be able to gain cross-credits for all your first-year courses
