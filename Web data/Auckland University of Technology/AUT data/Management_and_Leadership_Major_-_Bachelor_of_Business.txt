Organisations of all sizes, types and industries need managers who can deal with the myriad demands of leadership in the modern environment
Profitability, sustainability, innovation, social responsibility, stakeholder relations, market share and resource utilisation are just some of the issues that managers must face, which make this a stimulating and challenging career direction
A key aspect of management is the ability to get the best out of people, to motivate them and integrate their own professional development with the requirements of the business
This calls for extremely well-developed interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence, allied to a strong sense of commercial awareness
