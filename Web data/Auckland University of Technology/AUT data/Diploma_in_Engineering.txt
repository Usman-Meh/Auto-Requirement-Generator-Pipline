Study Menu In this section Home Study Study options Study engineering, computer and mathematical sciences Courses Diploma in Engineering Diploma in Engineering Want a career in engineering, but not sure what to expect from uni or from doing an engineering degree? Our Diploma in Engineering is another way into AUT and your dream degree
Start your university studies with our Diploma in Engineering
You’ll take the same courses as our first-year bachelor’s degree students, and study in a supportive environment with additional academic and student support
It’s a great way to try university, explore different engineering subjects and gain a qualification in one year
Once you’ve completed your diploma you can then move into Year 2 of the Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) or Bachelor of Engineering Technology
