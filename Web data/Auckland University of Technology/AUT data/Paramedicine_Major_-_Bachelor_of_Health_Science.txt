Study the Paramedicine major in the Bachelor of Health Science degree to prepare for this rewarding career
Paramedics are the backbone of emergency ambulance services run by St John and Wellington Free Ambulance, as well as helicopter rescue services
Paramedics often work independently in remote or difficult environments and have to make critical, often complex decisions
The Paramedicine major prepares you for these challenges
You learn from staff who are intensive care paramedics, emergency nurses, defence force medics, midwives, medical specialists and emergency management specialists
There’s a focus on practical experience with clinical placements in ambulance services, hospitals, mental health institutions, ski fields, and community or primary health centres
