Art History Minor
The minor in art history is designed for students interested in studying the history of visual art as an academic discipline. Courses for the minor have been selected to prepare students in the fundamentals of this discipline and to cover a range of historical periods — spanning prehistoric to contemporary — as well as a variety of media. One studio art class is included to enhance the student’s appreciation of the creative process and to strengthen their ability to write accurately about art.
The minor is offered by the School of the Arts, Maxwell Becton College of Arts and Sciences, at the Florham Campus, Madison, New Jersey.
