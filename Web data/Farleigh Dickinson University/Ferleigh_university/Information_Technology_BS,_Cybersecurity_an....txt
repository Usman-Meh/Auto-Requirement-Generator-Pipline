Computer Networks and
CSCI6738
Cybersecurity, when successfully completed under the 4 Plus 1 program, can be credited toward both the B.S. and M.S. degrees.
Students must have achieved a cumulative grade point ratio (CGPR) of at least 2.75. A minimum of 120 credits is required for the B.S. in information technology. In addition, for degree completion, the B.S. in information technology degree requires a minimum CGPR of 2.00, while the M.S. in computer engineering degree requires a minimum CGPR of 2.75.
Professional Accreditation and Other Designation
The B.S. in information technology program is accredited by the
Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET
(
https://www.abet.org
). This accreditation applies only to the B.S. in information technology program offered by the GHSCSE at the Metropolitan Campus, Teaneck, New Jersey.
Students completing the B.S. in information technology program with a concentration in security and forensics are eligible to receive a Certificate of Completion of a National Security Agency (NSA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-designated CAE-CDE program of study from FDU’s Center for Cybersecurity and Information Assurance (CCIA).

All five required courses in the network and system administration are already included in the IT core requirements, so students automatically fulfill this concentration. Four out of the five courses in the web-development technology concentration are also included in the IT core requirements, so students just need to take
INFO4844
Programming for the Internet (3 credits) to complete this concentration. Moreover, one of the five required courses in the security and forensics concentration is also part of the IT core requirements, so students must take the remaining four courses if they want to complete this concentration.
The 15-credit minor in computer forensics consists of 12 credits of four required courses and a 3-credit elective to be selected between two courses. Two of the required courses and one of the two elective courses are already included in the IT core requirements. Thus, IT majors only need to take the two remaining required courses,
CRIM2218
Computer Technologies and Cyber Crime (3 credits) and
CRIM3327
File System Forensic Analysis and Investigation (3 credits) in order to pursue the minor in computer forensics.
Students can do one of the following to complete the remaining four courses (12 credits):
Take the remaining four courses in the security and forensics concentration to complete this concentration and the minor in computer forensics.
Take
INFO4844
Programming for the Internet to fulfill the web-development technology concentration and either
Three 3-credit IT electives or
CRIM2218
Computer Technologies and Cyber Crime and
CRIM3327
File System Forensic Analysis and Investigation, the two remaining required courses — completing the minor in computer forensics — and one 3-credit IT elective course.
Take
CRIM2218
Computer Technologies and Cyber Crime and
CRIM3327
File System Forensic Analysis and Investigation — completing the minor in computer forensics — and two 3-credit IT elective courses.
Take four 3-credit IT electives.
Students must obtain prior approval from the GHSCSE academic adviser for any course selection. The required courses in the three concentrations are listed above. To take any course in the concentration, a student must meet all the prerequisites for that course. They must complete 15 credits of the required courses in the concentration to be eligible for a certificate in that area.
