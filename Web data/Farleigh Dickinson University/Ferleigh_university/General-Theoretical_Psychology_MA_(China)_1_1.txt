General-Theoretical Psychology MA (China)
Fairleigh Dickinson University has partnered with Golden Education to enroll students in this Master’s degree program in China. We offer high-quality teaching and provide Chinese students with an online learning experience. The general theoretical program is focused on individuals who want to better understand the different factors that affect human behavior and apply this knowledge to everyday life (self-understanding, interpersonal relationships, parenting, work-life balance, etc.). Students gain knowledge and understanding of a broad range of topics within the field of psychology (see course listings below) and learn basic methodological principles of behavioral science research.
This program prepares students for a variety of careers in industry (e.g., advertising, market research), government (e.g., program evaluation, criminal justice research), education, health sectors, and other organizations that utilize theories and methods of behavioral sciences. This program also prepares students for further study at the doctoral level in more specialized substantive areas of psychology (e.g., clinical psychology, developmental psychology, social psychology, etc.).
Length of the program: 18 months.
