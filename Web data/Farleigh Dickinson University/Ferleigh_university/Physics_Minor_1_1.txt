Physics Minor
The Department of Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Physics offers a minor in physics, as well as a wide range of physics courses for science and non-science majors.
The emphasis for the physics minor is on fundamental concepts, analytical methods, and critical thinking skills. A physics minor is an excellent addition to any Liberal Arts major, in which the goal is to produce a well-rounded person with the knowledge and skills to succeed in any field. If a student is interested in becoming more knowledgeable in physics and loves learning for its own sake, a physics minor is an outstanding way to begin to do so, while at the same time gaining valuable transferable skills and ways of thinking.
The 18-20 credit Physics minor is designed for students who enjoy physics and are interested in gaining a broader exposure to physics concepts, experimental techniques, and computational paradigms, while at the same time gaining transferable skills and ways of thinking applicable to jobs within their primary field of interest.

“A little-known secret is that a physicist is one of the most employable people in the marketplace – a physicist is a trained problem solver. How many times have you heard a person in a workplace say, “I wasn’t trained for this!” That’s an impossible reaction from a physicist, who would say, instead, “Cool!”
— Neil deGrasse Tyson
