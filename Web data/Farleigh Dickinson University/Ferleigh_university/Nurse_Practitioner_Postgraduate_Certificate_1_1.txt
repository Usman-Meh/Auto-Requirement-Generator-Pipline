Nurse Practitioner Postgraduate Certificate
The Post-graduate Certificate Program allows nurses who have a MSN/DNP degree from an accredited nursing program to become certified as a Nurse Practitioner in a second population concentration, including:
Adult Gerontology Primary Care
Family Primary Care
Psychiatric-Mental Health Care
Women’s Health Care
Upon completion of the Post-graduate Certificate curriculum, students are eligible to take the associated advanced practice nurse practitioner population-focused certification examination (i.e., ANCC, AANP, NCC).
Application Requirements
2.8 GPA (inclusive of all college transcripts).
MSN/DNP from an accredited (i.e., ACEN, CCNE) nursing program in advanced practice nursing (e.g., Nurse Practitioner, Nurse Midwifery, Nurse Anesthesia). (Graduates of MSN/DNP programs WITHOUT advanced practice nursing preparation and who seek to become a Nurse Practitioner should instead apply to our
Nurse Practitioner MSN Program
and can be offered advanced standing pending transcript review.)
Registered Nurse (RN) licensure from the state in which applicant will be conducting their 750 requisite clinical hours. (
Applicants from New York will need to show New Jersey RN license or proof of application, concurrent with selecting first clinical placement, as students who need assistance with site selection will be placed in New Jersey.
)
English-language proficiency (see
https://www.fdu.edu/admissions/international/english-proficiency/
).
Short resume (1-2 pages) summarizing education history/relevant activities, substantive healthcare experience, and license/registration/certification information (with URL to state verification site for each license).

(
or 3-credit course equivalents for advanced pharmacology, advanced pathophysiology, and advanced health assessment) must be identifiable on the MSN/DNP transcript in order to be eligible to apply for
certification examination upon program completion
.
A gap analysis will be conducted upon review of applicant transcripts to determine the need for additional coursework to fulfill this requirement.
For applicants who will have taken their 3-credit advanced pharmacology course more than five (5) years prior to expected completion of this
program and
filing for advanced practice nurse certification in New Jersey (and certain other states),
N.J.A.C.
