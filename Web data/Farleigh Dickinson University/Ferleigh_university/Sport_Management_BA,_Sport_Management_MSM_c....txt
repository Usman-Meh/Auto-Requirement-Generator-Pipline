Sport Management BA, Sport Management MSM combined degree
FDU’s innovative Bachelor of Arts and Master of Sport Management (BA/MSM) five-year combined degree program allows students to turn their passion for sports into a career. The sports industry is one of the largest areas of commerce in the United States, producing more than $213 billion annually. Each year, there’s a growing demand among employers for knowledgeable and skilled professionals in this exciting and competitive field. Get ready to jump-start your sports career after earning your Bachelor of Arts in Sport Management plus a Master of Sport Management in just five years!
Program description
In this highly personalized, interdisciplinary program, studies in sport management start on the first day of class. Students take sports-related courses plus classes that sharpen their business, information systems, and communications abilities. Courses prepare students for leadership responsibilities in such areas as professional sports administration, facility and event management, sports marketing and communications, athletic administration, advertising and promotion, and coaching.
The BA/MSM combined degree program is offered in-person on both FDU’s Metropolitan Campus in Teaneck and Florham Campus in Madison.
