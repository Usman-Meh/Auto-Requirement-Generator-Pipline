Digital Marketing Minor
The 15-credit digital marketing minor is offered for business and non-business majors by the Silberman College of Business at the Florham Campus, Madison, New Jersey, and at the Metropolitan Campus, Teaneck, New Jersey.
To have the selected minor recorded on the transcript, students must earn a cumulative grade point ratio of 2.00 or better in the minor. In general, courses that count toward the declared major do not count toward the minor.
Due to prerequisite courses, some, not all, minors are only open to students in the Silberman College of Business. Any student interested in pursuing a minor at Silberman College should contact an advisor in the
Silberman Academic Advising Office
