Minor in Event and Convention Management
.
Industry segments including social, corporate, association, convention, tradeshow, festival, and special events will be reviewed. Meeting planning from event inception to post event evaluation will be discussed. Students will gain an understanding of domestic and international meetings and the nuances of each.
Students will learn the various processes in achieving this by examining budgeting, site selection, menu creation, beverage planning, etc. The Minor is offered on the Metropolitan and Florham campuses, in New Jersey, and at the Vancouver Campus in British Columbia. Students in any major at FDU are eligible for the minor.
