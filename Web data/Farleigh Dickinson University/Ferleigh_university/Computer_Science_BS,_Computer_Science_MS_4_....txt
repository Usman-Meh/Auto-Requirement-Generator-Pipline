Computer Science BS, Computer Science MS 4 Plus 1 Program (Metro)
The Lee Gildart and Oswald Haase School of Computer Sciences and Engineering (GHSCSE) offers a 4 Plus 1 program that allows qualified students to obtain a Bachelor of Science (BS) in computer science degree. In particular, three graduate courses: CSCI6603 Computer Architecture (3 credits), CSCI6623 Database Systems (3 credits) and CSCI6638 Operating Systems (3 credits), when successfully completed under the 4 Plus 1 program, can be credited toward both the BS and the MS degrees. This program is offered by GHSCSE at the Metropolitan Campus, Teaneck, New Jersey. The BS in computer science program is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of
ABET
. This accreditation applies only to the BS in computer science program offered by the GHSCSE at the Metropolitan Campus.
Students in the BS in computer science program must take one of the three concentrations:
Big Data Analytics
Cybersecurity and Information Assurance
Game and Mobile Application Development.
Students completing the BS in computer science program with a concentration in cybersecurity and information assurance are eligible to receive a Certificate of Completion of a National Security Agency (NSA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-designated CAE-CDE program of study from FDU’s Center for Cybersecurity and Information Assurance (CCIA). CAE-CDE denotes the Center for Academic Excellence for Cyber Defense Education.
