Biology Minor
The Biology minor is for students NOT majoring in Biology, Marine Biology, or Science. The minor in Biology consists of five courses and a laboratory that will give students a broad foundation in the subject. Students interested in environmental areas should select the Ecology/ Genetics cluster while those interested in health-related areas should select the Anatomy and Physiology cluster.
