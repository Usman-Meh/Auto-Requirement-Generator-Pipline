Mathematics BS (Metro)
The Lee Gildart and Oswald Haase School of Computer Sciences and Engineering (GHSCSE) offers a B.S. in mathematics program at the Metropolitan Campus, Teaneck, New Jersey. The program has two concentrations:
Applied Mathematics
Pure Mathematics
Each concentration prepares students to work in industry, government, business or education, as well as for graduate study in mathematics, education, business and other closely related STEM fields, particularly in the interdisciplinary areas of artificial intelligence, computer science, cybersecurity, data science and machine learning. Students are encouraged to complete a minor in computer science, which they can easily accomplish through the electives.
Students who choose the applied mathematics concentration typically take elective courses in mathematics and related subjects, focusing on methods used to solve problems in quantitative fields of study. Those who choose the pure mathematics concentration typically take more theoretical elective courses which focus on strengthening their knowledge of mathematical fundamentals. In both the applied and pure mathematics concentrations, students are exposed via a highly flexible curriculum to the kind of rigorous analysis, logic, and critical thinking that will help them to succeed in their chosen careers and/or advanced studies.  For these two concentrations, students meet with an academic adviser to discuss their course sequence and electives of the concentration based on their goals and interests.
Students in the B.S. in mathematics program can also pursue one of the three 4 Plus 1 programs. The three 4 Plus 1 programs are as follows:
BS. in Mathematics/M.A. in Teaching Combined Degree Program (QUEST)
BS. in Mathematics/M.S. in Computer Science Combined Degree Program
BS. in Mathematics/M.S. in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance Combined Degree Program
GHSCSE also offers a
Bachelor of Art in mathematics
at the Metropolitan Campus. The educational objectives of the B.A. and B.S. in mathematics programs are fundamentally the same except that the B.A. in mathematics program is built on a liberal arts foundation. The non-mathematics requirements for the two programs are different.
Educational Objectives
The educational objectives of the B.S. in mathematics program define the skills, knowledge and attributes that will be needed and achieved by the graduates for a successful career and professional accomplishments three to four years after graduation. The program will produce graduates who:
Have an appropriate combination of theoretical knowledge and practical skills in mathematics to enter into and advance professionally in mathematics and related fields.
Have a well-rounded education that encourages and supports meaningful dialogue with individuals from other disciplines.
Are able to adapt to and succeed in a dynamic global environment.
Can engage effectively in oral, written and graphical communications in both interpersonal and public settings.
Are prepared to participate in life-long learning opportunities.
Are prepared to continue formal education and obtain advanced degrees in mathematics or related fields.
These objectives are consistent with the mission of Fairleigh Dickinson University to educate and prepare students as world citizens through global education. They also fulfill the needs of our constituencies.
Cooperative Education Option
Students in the B.S. in Mathematics program have the option to undertake a cooperative education experience and earn a total of 6 academic credits toward their electives. Note that these credits may not be substituted for any required course work. The co-op experience provides students a real-world grounding, linking theory and practice, academic and work experiences, and college education and lifelong learning. It better prepares students for jobs, gives them a competitive edge in the job market, helps them develop networking skills and professional contacts and allows them to experience career fields before graduation. Employers benefit from better-prepared graduates with real and relevant work experience – saving time and money by reducing the training period for new employees.
Degree Plan
Students must choose a concentration in applied mathematics or pure mathematics. Regardless of the concentration, the B.S. in Mathematics program requires the successful completion of 120 credits with a minimum cumulative grade point ratio of 2.00 as described below.
Applied Mathematics or Pure Mathematics Concentration
The following is for a Bachelor of Science in mathematics with either an applied mathematics or pure mathematics concentration. Students must meet with their advisers to discuss the course sequence for either one of the two concentrations.
