Criminal Justice BA
The Criminal Justice curriculum is designed to skillfully integrate theory and academic constructs in direct relationship with the operational realities that influence and shape the ever-changing nature and composite of the United States criminal justice system.
The curriculum closely examines:
the nature and incidence of crime;
theories of criminality and punishment;
the interdependent operation of the various components of the criminal justice system, which comprise police and law enforcement, the courts and adjudication process, and corrections;
the organizational and personnel management theories relevant to criminal justice management and administration;
the use and application of the state-of-the art computers and information technologies;
forensic psychology;
the forensic sciences;
the impact of major social problems on crime and the criminal justice system, and the growing implications of cyber-crime, terrorism, and transnational crime.
