Accounting Minor
Accounting is the language of business. Whether students are interested in starting their own small businesses or working for a Fortune 500 company, knowledge of the basics of accounting and financial reporting will provide a deeper understanding of the tools used in running a business.
The
accounting minor is offered only for business majors
by the Silberman College of Business at the Florham Campus, Madison, New Jersey, and at the Metropolitan Campus, Teaneck, New Jersey.
To have the selected minor recorded on the transcript, students must earn a cumulative grade point ratio of 2.00 or better in the minor. In general, courses that count toward the declared major do not count toward the minor. The main exception to this rule applies to students in the business administration major, who can apply a maximum of two qualifying courses toward both their major and a minor; other exceptions are noted specifically in each minor.
