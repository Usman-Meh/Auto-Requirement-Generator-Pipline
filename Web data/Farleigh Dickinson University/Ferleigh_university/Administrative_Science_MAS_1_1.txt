The
Master of Administrative Science (MAS)
degree in the School of Public and Global Affair is a 30-credit program structured to meet the career development needs of adult learners working in administrative and professional positions in the private sector, government agencies, and not-for-profit organizations. Its primary purpose is to enhance the administrative and leadership skills of graduates. The MAS is FDU’s largest part-time graduate studies program.
Designed primarily to serve adult students with five or more years of relevant professional work experience, the degree is targeted toward working adults. Admissions are based on multiple criteria, including the applicant’s career and other accomplishments, personal maturity, and evidence of commitment to graduate study and continued professional development. Special consideration will be given to applicants who have a significant record of relevant professional and/or administrative experience.
