Biochemistry BS (Prepharmacy concentration)
The Bachelor of Science with a major in biochemistry program with a concentration in pre-pharmacy is designed for students who plan to enter graduate school in pharmaceutical science or the pharmaceutical industry. It is designed to meet the entrance requirements for the FDU School of Pharmacy but it also contains the entrance requirements for most schools of pharmacy. In addition to the basic school of pharmacy entrance requirements, the program includes basic pharmaceutical chemistry courses designed to give the student a strong foundation in pharmaceutical chemistry. These are Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacology and Introduction to Medicinal Chemistry. Additional pharmaceutical chemistry major electives are also available. The curriculum is certified by the
American Chemical Society
if the student meets the required 400 laboratory course hours. Pre-professional counseling for science and health careers is available on campus.
Special Information
Curriculum is certified by the
American Chemical Society
if the student meets the 400 hour laboratory minimum.
Program Learning Outcomes
At the conclusion of this program, graduates will be able to:
Demonstrate a solid foundation in biochemistry including the vocabulary, concepts, methods, and procedures that will allow them to be competitive when entering industry, graduate, and professional schools.
Write and speak clearly on biochemical topics and demonstrate a mastery of these topics through their written and oral communications.
Excel at utilizing information resources including primary and secondary literature in the field using modern tools to locate and retrieve scientific information.
Demonstrate qualitative and quantitative critical reasoning skills allowing them to interpret experimental data and evaluate its significance.
Use standard laboratory equipment, modern instrumentation, and classical techniques to carry out experiments while following proper procedures and regulations for safe handling and use of chemicals and equipment.
