PA Studies MS
The FDU PA Program is committed to preparing future socially responsible professionals that possess the academic knowledge, clinical skills, and professional attitudes requisite for providing compassionate patient-centered care in a dynamic healthcare system.  With that in mind, the program developed its mission and goals and designed a curriculum that would provide learning experiences that promote the acquisition of those same skills. The FDU PA Program developed a two-and-a-half-year curriculum leading to a Master of Science (MS) in PA Studies.
