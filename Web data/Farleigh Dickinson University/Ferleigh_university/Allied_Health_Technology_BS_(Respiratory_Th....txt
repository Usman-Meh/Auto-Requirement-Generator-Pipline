Allied Health Technology BS (Respiratory Therapy concentration)
Respiratory Therapists are in high demand to care for the increasing number of people with acute and chronic breathing disorders.
They treat a range of patients, from premature infants whose lungs are not fully developed to elderly people with lung disease. They give patients oxygen, manage ventilators, and administer drugs to the lungs. Respiratory therapists primarily work in hospitals, but many also start their own respiratory care companies or move into equipment marketing and sales. After completing a respiratory therapy degree program, graduates must take the certification exam to become a certified respiratory therapist or a registered respiratory therapist. Every state (except Alaska) requires that respiratory therapists also obtain a state license.
The
Bachelor of Science (BS) in Allied Health Technology/Respiratory Care Concentration
is a four-year program that provides the graduate with the knowledge, skills, and clinical experience to perform entry-level competencies as a Respiratory Therapist/Respiratory Care Practitioner in a range of health care settings. In addition, the program will provide curricular content including management, quality, finance, research, and advanced clinical practice for the graduate Respiratory Care Practitioner, to assume leadership roles in the health care profession.
We are currently approved by the New Jersey Presidents’ Council (NJPC) to administer this degree program and are awaiting
Commission on Accreditation of Respiratory Care
accreditation prior to enrolling students.  If you are interested in becoming a Respiratory Therapist, please contact Professor Smith-Wenning (
k.smithwenning@fdu.edu
) for the most updated information on student enrollment in this track.
Program Goals
In accordance with the Commission on Accreditation of Respiratory Care (CoARC), the primary objectives for this program are:
To prepare graduates with demonstrated competence in the cognitive (knowledge), psychomotor (skills), and affective (behavior) learning domains of respiratory care practice as performed by Registered Respiratory Therapists (RRTs)
To prepare leaders for the field of respiratory care by including curricular content with objectives related to the acquisition of skills in one or more of the following: management, education, research and advanced clinical practice (which may include an area of clinical specialization).
Admission Requirements
Graduation from an accredited secondary school with a record indicating the potential to succeed in college will be considered for admission to the FDU BS in Allied Health Technology/Respiratory Therapy Concentration:
Secondary school GPA of 2.7 or higher.
Completion of at least 16 high school units including the following high school studies:
4 units of English
1 unit of Chemistry + Lab

Curriculum
(under review)
A minimum of 120 credits is required for graduation from the FDU BS in Allied Health Technology degree program.
**Accuplacer reading/writing scores and math assessment scores will determine which reading/writing and math courses first time, first year students will take.  Those with reading/writing placement scores below the standards must complete courses in prerequisite skills (e.g., WRIT 1000, WRIT 1001, READ 1000). Those with math placement scores below the standards must complete courses in prerequisite skills (e.g., MATH 0298, MATH 1100).  These credits are applied toward free electives or are non-credit-bearing.
This requirement applies to all first time, first year students, even if they have been accepted into this program track.
