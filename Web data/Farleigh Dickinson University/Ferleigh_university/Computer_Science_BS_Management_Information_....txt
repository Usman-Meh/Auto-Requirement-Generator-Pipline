Computer Science BS Management Information Systems MS 4 Plus 1 Program
The Lee Gildart and Oswald Haase School of Computer Sciences and Engineering (GHSCSE) offers a 4 Plus 1 program that allows qualified students to obtain a Bachelor of Science (BS) in computer science degree and a Master of Science (MS) in management information systems degree with a combined course load that is 9 credits less. In particular, three graduate courses:
CSCI6603
Computer Architecture (3 credits),
CSCI6623
Database Systems (3 credits) and
CSCI6638
Operating Systems (3 credits), when successfully completed under the 4 Plus 1 program, can be credited toward both the BS and the MS degrees.
This combined degree program is offered by GHSCSE at the Metropolitan Campus, Teaneck, New Jersey. The BS in computer science program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of
ABET
. This accreditation applies only to the BS in computer science program offered by the GHSCSE at the Metropolitan Campus.
Students in the BS in computer science program must take one of the three concentrations: big data analytics, cybersecurity and information assurance or mobile and game app development. Students completing the BS in computer science program with a concentration in cybersecurity and information assurance are eligible to receive a Certificate of Completion of a National Security Agency (NSA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-designated CAE-CDE program of study from FDU’s Center for Cybersecurity and Information Assurance (CCIA).
Students must have achieved a cumulative grade point ratio (CGPR) of at least 2.75. A minimum of 120 credits is required for the BS in computer science degree.
