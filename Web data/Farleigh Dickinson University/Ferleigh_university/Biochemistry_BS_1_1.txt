Biochemistry BS
The Bachelor of Science with a major in biochemistry program is designed for students who plan to enter graduate school or the chemical or pharmaceutical industry. In particular, it is ideal for the pre-professional student preparing for admission into a school of medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine or physical therapy. The curriculum is certified by the
American Chemical Society
. (Florham)
The biochemistry curriculum is particularly well suited to premedical students. Entrance requirement for most medical schools require an undergraduate program to include a two semesters of biology, physics, English composition, and some calculus in addition to a strong chemistry background. Pre-professional counseling for science and health careers is available on campus.
Program Learning Outcomes
At the conclusion of this program, graduates will be able to:
Demonstrate a solid foundation in biochemistry including the vocabulary, concepts, methods, and procedures that will allow them to be competitive when entering industry, graduate, and professional schools.
Write and speak clearly on biochemical topics and demonstrate a mastery of these topics through their written and oral communications.
Excel at utilizing information resources including primary and secondary literature in the field using modern tools to locate and retrieve scientific information.
Demonstrate qualitative and quantitative critical reasoning skills allowing them to interpret experimental data and evaluate its significance.
Use standard laboratory equipment, modern instrumentation, and classical techniques to carry out experiments while following proper procedures and regulations for safe handling and use of chemicals and equipment.
