Nursing Practice DNP
The FDU School of Nursing and Allied Health Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Program provides advanced practice nurses and nurse executives with advanced knowledge of organizational leadership, systems analysis, and evidence-based practice (EBP) to lead innovations in practice settings, educational institutions, and other healthcare organizations. There is a strong focus on survey methodology, including the development of valid tools for data collection and the analysis of data from these tools. Using the state-of-the-art
Ovid® Synthesis “virtual” practice change project platform, students are able to identify issues in their own health care system or community and propose practical solutions to improve patient or population outcomes, while engaging remotely with university and library resources. Many of these projects are successfully and sustainably implemented upon graduation.
Application Requirements
MSN degree from an accredited nursing program (or, for RNs with a MS degree in another field, an individualized bridge program is available).
2.8 GPA (inclusive of all college transcripts).
Registered Nurse (RN) licensure – any state.
Optional/Preferred Requirements
Relevant experience in advanced practice nursing.
Letter(s) of recommendation.
