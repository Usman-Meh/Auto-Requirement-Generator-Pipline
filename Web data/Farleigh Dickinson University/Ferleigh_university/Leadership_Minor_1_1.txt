Leadership Minor
The 15-credit leadership minor is offered for business and non-business majors by the Silberman College of Business at the Florham Campus, Madison, New Jersey, and at the Metropolitan Campus, Teaneck, New Jersey.
To have the selected minor recorded on the transcript, students must earn a cumulative grade point ratio of 2.00 or better in the minor. In general, courses that count toward the declared major do not count toward the minor. The main exception to this rule applies to students in the business administration major, who can apply a maximum of two qualifying courses toward both their major and a minor; other exceptions are noted specifically in each minor.
Due to prerequisite courses, some, not all, minors are only open to students in the Silberman College of Business. Any student interested in pursuing a minor at Silberman College should contact an adviser in the
Silberman Academic Advising Office
. Current students should refer to their degree audit in Self-Service for the most accurate program requirements.
