Specialized focus on taxation
The MS in Taxation program is highly focused and practice-oriented. In scope, it is much more specific than the traditional course of study pursued in an MBA program with a concentration in tax. The MST is dedicated exclusively to the study of taxation.
The program was designed to provide you with both the practical knowledge and technical expertise needed to succeed as a tax professional. The program is ideal for practicing accountants and attorneys, financial planners, recent accounting graduates, and non-accountants wishing to enter the field of taxation. Both entry-level and experienced professionals will benefit from the program.
Emphasis is placed on technical competence in practical applications of current tax law as well as research and planning. Students in the program are exposed to all areas of taxation, including partnerships, corporate, international, trusts, compensation, and estate taxation. Courses not only cover the basics of taxation, but also advanced subject matter and procedural areas of tax law.

Frequently asked questions
Is the GMAT or GRE required for admission to the MS in Taxation program?
There are many pathways to admission. Please refer to the
Admissions Requirements
for further details.
Where and when are classes offered? Do I need to take classes during tax season?
Starting in fall 2020, MS in Taxation classes are being offered in a remote format and delivered online. Typically evening classes start at 6 PM. Students will not be required to come to campus, but will need internet access to log into class sessions.
For students needing to complete pre-requisite classes, such classes may be taken either online or in-person at either our Florham Campus in Madison, NJ, or at the Metro Campus in Hackensack, NJ. Alternatively, and with prior Department permission, pre-requisite classes may be taken at other AACSB institutions with an earned grade of B or better.
To accommodate the busy schedule of working professionals, classes are offered on weekday evenings, occasionally on Saturdays, and during summers.
Classes are generally not scheduled during the peak of tax season.
Can I start the MS in Taxation program at any time?
Yes. The cycle of classes typically begins in the fall semester, but you can enter the program at any time, subject to class scheduling. You may take courses at the pace that suits your work-life demands – as many as three classes or as few as one class per semester or even skipping a semester on occasion. All course work (including pre-requisites) must be completed within seven years.
Do MS in Taxation courses satisfy the CPA exam requirements?
Credits in the MS in Taxation program may qualify towards the 150-semester hours of education requirements for obtaining the CPA certification. Details on what will qualify may vary from state to state according to the rules of each state accounting board.
Do MS in Taxation courses satisfy CPE requirements in NJ?
Current students and alumni of the program may take courses to enhance their expertise in specific areas or to meet Continuing Professional Education (CPE) requirements. CPE credits for university and college courses are set forth by the New Jersey State Board of Accountancy in the Law and Public Safety Chapter of the NJ Administrative Code under sections 13:29-6.5(a)(2) and 13:29-6.8(a).
Degree Requirements
The MS in Taxation degree is obtained by completing 30 credits in required and elective courses. Additional prerequisite courses, described below, may be required for those students not meeting the appropriate undergraduate requirements.
The seven core courses (21 credits) are required of all students. The remaining courses (9 credits) may be selected from electives. Subject to prerequisites, there is no set order in which the courses have to be taken.
To graduate, you must maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 or better.
Prerequisite Courses
Several of the five prerequisite courses, including Individual Taxation (
ACCT6605
or
ACCT4267
), must be completed before starting the required coursework in the MS in Taxation. CPAs and accounting majors are typically able to waive four of the five prerequisite courses based on prior coursework. The fifth course, Entity Taxation (
ACCT6606
), may be taken concurrently with MS in Taxation courses and should be taken as early as possible since this class is a specific prerequisite for several of the MS in Taxation classes.
The five prerequisite courses are:
Financial Accounting – 3 credits:
ACCT 2021
,
ACCT 6400
, or course equivalent
Individual Taxation – 3 credits:
ACCT6605
,
ACCT4267
, or course equivalent
Entity Taxation – 3 credits:
ACCT6606
or course equivalent
Business Law – 3 credits:
LAW6657
or course equivalent
Finance – 3 credits:
FIN3250
,
FIN3310
,
FIN 6020
,
FIN 6400,
or course equivalent
A prerequisite course may be waived if you have previously completed the course at FDU (or an equivalent course elsewhere) within the prior five years with a grade of B or better. Waiver of courses is determined based on the review of the department chair.
