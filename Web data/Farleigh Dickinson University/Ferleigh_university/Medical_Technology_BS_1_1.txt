Medical Technology BS
Medical Laboratory Scientists (also known as “Clinical Laboratory Scientists” and formerly known as “Medical Technologists”) are clinical laboratory professionals who play a major role in patient care, providing laboratory data which are crucial for the diagnosis of diseases, the management of patient therapy and maintenance of health. Medical Laboratory scientists perform a wide variety of analytical procedures requiring expertise in state-of-the-art technology and instrumentation, as well as organizational, problem solving and communication skills. Major disciplines in medical technology include clinical chemistry, clinical immunology, clinical microbiology, hematology, and immunohematology. They perform sophisticated chemical, biological, microscopic, and bacteriological tests using some of the most advanced equipment in healthcare. For example, medical laboratory scientists microscopically examine blood, make cultures of fluid or tissues the samples, use computers to verify and organize lab data, and analyze the samples for chemical content or reaction.
Medical Laboratory Scientists have the versatility to be employed in a variety of settings, including hospitals, independent laboratories, clinics, physicians’ offices, local/state and government agencies, pharmaceutical and cosmetic firms, veterinary offices, and research institutions.
Employment rate in various healthcare laboratories in the tri-state area: 100%
Starting salary after degree completion by the Bureau of Labor Statistics: >$70,000
The
Bachelor of Science (BS)
in Medical Technology
degree prepares students for the medical profession as Medical Laboratory Scientists through a partnership with an accredited hospital-based Medical Laboratory Science (MLS) internship program. Upon successful completion of the degree requirements, the student will qualify for the examination given by the Board of Registry of the
American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP)
for the
certification as a Clinical Laboratory Scientist (CLS-ASCP)
.  A clinical training program (such as this MLS internship program at an accredited hospital) is required of students who wish to qualify for the examination given by the Board of Registry of the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) for the certification as a Clinical Laboratory Scientist (CLS-ASCP).
NAACLS Articulations for FDU Students
There are
several hospitals in New Jersey
approved by the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (
NAACLS
) to administer this program and which have affiliation agreements with FDU. Admissions requirements and application instructions are available on the websites of these respective NAACLS partners:
Hackensack Meridian Health Florence M. Cook School of MLS at Jersey Shore Medical Center
RWJBarnabas Health John A. Mihok School of MLS at Monmouth Medical Center
William O. Green School of Medical Technology at Valley Hospital
Students complete 6 semesters of pre-professional courses at FDU before applying to the 12-month hospital program that is accredited by the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (
NAACLS
). Each approved hospital internship website describes program highlights, admissions criteria, curriculum, and FAQs. In addition,
Zoom
info-sessions may be offered periodically.
This MLS hospital internship can be particularly valuable if as student is interested in pursuing a career in a specific area of laboratory medicine. This experience, with rotations to multiple departments within the single hospital system, and with many opportunities for hospital personnel to engage the student as a prospective employee, often leads the student to employment in that hospital.  Financial aid is not available through FDU when attending the MLS internship program, however many programs offer their own financial aid. Tuition is paid directly to the MLS internship program during this phase of study. Upon completion of degree requirements, the student will receive a diploma from FDU and a certificate of completion from the MLS hospital internship program.
Admission Requirements
Graduates from an accredited secondary school with a record indicating the potential to succeed in college will be considered for admission to the FDU BS in Clinical Laboratory Science.
Completion of the following high school studies:
4 units of English
1 unit of Chemistry + Lab
2 units of History
1 unit of Biology + Lab
2 units of college preparatory Mathematics
At least 16 high school academic units
Secondary school GPA of 2.7 or higher
Admission to
Hospital Internship Experience
Students will submit a separate application in the fall semester of their sophomore year (second semester of year 2 at FDU).
Admission decisions to the internship program is made in accordance with criteria, policies and procedures established by the hospital and cannot be guaranteed by FDU.
Students generally
need to demonstrate at least a 2.85 GPA
in major and prerequisite courses at FDU to be considered for admission to the internship program. All prerequisite courses must be completed with a grade of C or higher, and certain prerequisite courses must be completed with a grade of B minus or higher.
Students must apply in their 3rd year at FDU for the MLS internship program at an accredited hospital. Application and admission processes are slightly different for each hospital. It is the student’s responsibility to regularly check the hospital websites for updates to the application and admission procedure and deadlines. It is recommended for applicants to apply when the application period opens due to the program’s competitiveness.
Admission to the clinical training program is competitive. Hospitals accept only 4-10 students per class, depending on the hospital site.
Students who are not selected for a clinical training program may continue at FDU for a BS in Health Studies. Upon completion of the BS degree, students may again apply for the Rutgers Clinical Training Program to earn a certificate which will allow qualification for the ASCP examination.
Curriculum
(Updated for Fall 2024)
A minimum of 124 credits is required for graduation from the FDU BS in Medical Technology (Hospital Internship) to become a Clinical/Medical Laboratory Scientist.
After completion of 3 years of study at FDU (minimum 94 credits, of which 40 are GenEd and 54 are courses in the major), the program is completed in 12 months through one of several hospital internships. Students will be awarded 30 academic credits upon completion of the hospital internship program.
**Accuplacer reading/writing scores and math assessment scores will determine which reading/writing and math courses first time, first year students will take.  Those with reading/writing placement scores below the standards must complete courses in prerequisite skills (e.g., WRIT 1000, WRIT 1001, READ 1000). Those with math placement scores below the standards must complete courses in prerequisite skills (e.g., MATH 0298, MATH 1100).  These courses are applied toward free electives or are non-credit-bearing.
This requirement applies to all first time, first year students, even if they have been accepted into this program track.

Other Considerations
FDU offers two four-year degree programs geared to qualifying for and passing the examination by
the Board of Registry of the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) for the certification as a Clinical Laboratory Scientist (CLS-ASCP). These are the
Clinical Laboratory Sciences BS
(this program) and the
Medical Technology BS
(see other FDU web page). The first three years of the Academic Program Plan for the two degrees are identical, and the courses can be taken at either NJ campus. The fourth year of the Clinical Laboratory Sciences BS is training at Rutgers University and its affiliates. The fourth year of the Medical Technology BS is a hospital-based internship at Valley Hospital (Bergen County),
Hackensack Meridian Health Jersey Shore Medical Center (Neptune City), Monmouth Medical Center (Long Branch),
or at another approved hospital system.
Both the clinical training program at Rutgers University and the hospital-based internship provides appropriate preparation for the ASCP certification as a Clinical Laboratory Scientist. Both are competitive admissions programs.
Clinical Laboratory Sciences BS (University Training Program)
–
The clinical training program at Rutgers School of Health Professions offers a more structured educational experience. Students generally have the opportunity to rotate through different hospitals and experience a range of practice settings. This program can provide a more comprehensive understanding of laboratory medicine and prepare the student for a wider range of career opportunities.
Medical Technology BS (Hospital Internship Program) –
A hospital-based internship offers hands-on experience in a clinical laboratory setting, allowing skills and knowledge to develop under the guidance of working professionals. Students have the opportunity to rotate through different departments within the laboratory, gaining exposure to a variety of laboratory techniques and instrumentation. This experience can be particularly valuable if a student is interested in pursuing a career in a specific area of laboratory medicine. The hospital-based experience, with rotations to multiple departments within the single hospital system, and with many opportunities for hospital personnel to engage the student as a prospective employee, often leads the student to employment in that hospital.
Geography may also play a role in your preference. The Allied Health faculty and staff at FDU will have at least anecdotal and sometimes statistical guidance about each of these options.
