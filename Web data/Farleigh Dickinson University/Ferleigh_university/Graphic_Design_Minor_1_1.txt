Graphic Design Minor
The 15-credit minor in Graphic Design (previously called the Computer Graphics minor) will prepare students to understand, formulate and create design solutions for a variety of visual communication problems in print, the web, and other two-dimensional design contexts.
To achieve this goal, the courses in this minor seek to instill in students the conceptual foundations for understanding design, the desire to develop visual sensitivity, and the requisite traditional and software skills necessary to confront real-world design situations competitively.
