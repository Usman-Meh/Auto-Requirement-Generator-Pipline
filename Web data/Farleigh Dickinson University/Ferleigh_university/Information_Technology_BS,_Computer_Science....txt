Information Technology BS, Computer Science MS 4 Plus 1 Program
The Lee Gildart and Oswald Haase School of Computer Sciences and Engineering (GHSCSE) offers a 4 Plus1 program that allows qualified students to obtain a Bachelor of Science (BS) in information technology (IT) with a pathway to the Master of Science (MS) in computer science. In particular, three graduate courses:
CSCI6623
Database Systems (3 credits),
CSCI6638
Operating Systems (3 credits), and
CSCI6731
Computer Networks (3 credits), when successfully completed under the 4 Plus 1 program, can be credited toward both the BS and the MS degrees. Students can take one or more of the three concentrations:
network and system administration
,
security and forensics
and
web-development technology
in the BS in information technology program. This combined-degree program is offered by the GHSCSE at the Metropolitan Campus, Teaneck, New Jersey.
Students must have achieved a cumulative grade point ratio (CGPR) of at least 2.75. A minimum of 120 credits is required for the BS in information technology. In addition, for degree completion, the BS in information technology degree requires a minimum CGPR of 2.00, while the MS in computer science degree requires a minimum CGPR of 2.75.
Professional Accreditation and Other Designation
The BS in information technology program is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET-
https://www.abet.org
.
This accreditation applies only to the BS in information technology program offered by the GHSCSE at the Metropolitan Campus, Teaneck, New Jersey.
Students completing the BS in information technology program with a concentration in security and forensics are eligible to receive a Certificate of Completion of a National Security Agency (NSA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-designated CAE-CDE program of study from FDU’s Center for Cybersecurity and Information Assurance (CCIA). CAE-CDE denotes the Center for Academic Excellence for Cyber Defense Education.
Cooperative Education Option
Students in the BS in information technology program have the option to undertake a cooperative education experience and earn a total of 6 academic credits toward their technical electives
Scholarship – DoD CySP
Students pursuing the BSIT degree program with the Concentration in Security and Forensics are eligible to apply for the prestigious Department of Defense (DoD) Cyber Scholarship Program (CySP). Apart from paying for the full tuition and fees, the Cyber Scholars receive a lucrative $25,000 a year stipend until graduation, guaranteed paid summer internship at the DoD Agency and a job offer on graduation.
