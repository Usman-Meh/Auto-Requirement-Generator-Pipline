Sport Management BA
The Bachelor of Arts in Sport Management (BASM) program provides undergraduate-level studies for traditional and non-traditional students seeking a career in Sport Management, including in the areas of recreation, youth, collegiate, and professional leagues.
The program provides students with a unique academic experience: a strong background in the fundamental aspects of Sport Management (law, finance, marketing, and fundraising), as well as specialization in a particular area of sport (coaching, fitness, and facilities, among others). It supports the success of students in the educational process and prepares them to be world citizens through global education while encouraging the development of applied research for practitioners in the field of sports and recreation management.
The BASM Program is administered from the Metropolitan and Florham Campuses and conducted in the traditional on-campus format. It is also available off-campus (weeknights and Saturdays) and online.
