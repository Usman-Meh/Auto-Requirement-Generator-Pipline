Cinema Studies Minor
The 15-credit cinema studies minor (previously called the film studies minor) is designed for students interested in studying movie as texts and as popular culture. Traditionally, students of this discipline study the history, production processes, and aesthetics of film as well as the theories that analyze the ways in which film, culture, and audience interact to negotiate and construct meaning.
The minor is offered by the School of the Arts, Maxwell Becton College of Arts and Sciences, at the Florham Campus, Madison, New Jersey.
The two required courses provide the foundations for these four areas of investigation (history, production, aesthetics, and theory). The electives offer an opportunity for a wider breadth of experience or a more tightly focused study.
