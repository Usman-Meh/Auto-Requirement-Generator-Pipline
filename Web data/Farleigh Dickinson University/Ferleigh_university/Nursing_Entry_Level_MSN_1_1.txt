Nursing Entry Level MSN
The 2-year (6-7 semester) Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) Entry-to-Practice program prepares a student to become a professional nurse at the Masters degree level to better meet leadership demands in our dynamic health care system. Graduates of the program are qualified for the role of a baccalaureate prepared generalist nurse as described by the
American Association of Colleges of Nursing
and are eligible to take the
NCLEX-RN
for licensure as a registered nurse. The MSN Entry-to-Practice program is a 72-credit curriculum (16 credits more than the Accelerated BSN program curriculum).  Graduates can apply to the clinical-based
Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Program
with 9-12 credits already completed or can apply to the
Nurse Practitioner (MSN) Program
with advanced standing.
Admissions to the MSN Entry-to-Practice program are offered on a rolling basis, with students beginning in Spring, Summer or Fall. If you have completed a Bachelor degree program and are seeking to become an RN, please also consider our
Nursing BSN Accelerated
program.)
