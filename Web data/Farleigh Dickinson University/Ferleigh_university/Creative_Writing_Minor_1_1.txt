Creative Writing Minor
The creative writing minor is a flexible add-on to your major that enhances your communication skills while exploring your passion for books, words, and storytelling. It is a perfect complement to majors, such as Marketing, Politics & Law, Film, Graphic Design, Theater, and many more.
