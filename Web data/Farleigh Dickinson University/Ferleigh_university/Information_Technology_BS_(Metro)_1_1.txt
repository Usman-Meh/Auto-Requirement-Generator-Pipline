Career Opportunities
Information technology is credited with being a major factor in increased productivity and the driving force behind the new global economy. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that computer support specialists held 565,700 jobs in 2008; computer network, systems and database administrators, 961,200 jobs. BLS also projects an employment growth of 14 percent for the former job category and 30 percent for the latter one from 2008 to 2018.
The two growth rates are higher than the average rate for all occupations. Other IT and computer-related jobs are expected to grow at a faster rate as well. The great demand for IT professionals, not only in the New York and New Jersey areas but throughout the country and the world, ensures graduates of strong employment opportunities following completion of the program.
