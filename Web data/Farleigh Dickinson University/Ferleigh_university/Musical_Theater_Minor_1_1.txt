Musical Theater Minor
The 15-credit musical theater minor enables students interested in this subject to take a series of basic courses in acting, singing, and dance, followed by choices in a more specific area of dance or musical theater. This minor is available to non-theater arts majors. Minors are also encouraged to audition for or to crew departmental productions in either of FDU’s two theaters: Dreyfuss Theater and the Barn Theater. Between these spaces, the School of the Arts mounts a full season of productions each year including musicals, providing opportunities for hands-on application of classroom learning.
The minor is offered by the School of the Arts, Maxwell Becton College of Arts and Sciences, at the Florham Campus, Madison, New Jersey.
