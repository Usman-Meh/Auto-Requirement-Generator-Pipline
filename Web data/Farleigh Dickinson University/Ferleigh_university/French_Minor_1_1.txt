French Minor
The 15-credit French Language Minor is comprised of the sequence of language courses indicated below. This ensures that the student who has completed this Minor will be reasonably fluent in the language and capable of reading and appreciating written and oral communication in French while also having a fair grasp of French Literature and culture.
Students who are assessed as sufficiently advanced in the language so as to opt out of one or more of the required language courses may choose from the array of FRENCH courses, with work done in the target language. The student who takes all 4 language courses is left with one additional course needed to complete the Minor; this course can also be selected from the available FRENCH courses that are offered regularly, with work done in the target language. At most, one course may be taken in English.
