Learning Disabilities MA
Fairleigh Dickinson University's program is accredited by Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP).
Graduate Programs in Learning Disabilities
Licensed regular classroom teachers may seek to develop expertise in working with students with disabilities in grades K-12. Through our program, candidates may decide to:
Enter a 21-credit, fully online, non-degree program leading to the New Jersey Teacher of Students with Disabilities Certification; OR
Enter a 36 credit, master’s degree program leading to the New Jersey Teacher of Students with Disabilities Certification AND a master’s degree. We offer three tracks for candidates pursuing this degree: a learning disabilities track, a supervisory track, or an Orton Gillingham Teacher concentration.
Candidates who successfully complete these programs are eligible for New Jersey’s Department of Education certification as Teacher of Students with Disabilities. This license is required for teaching students with disabilities in settings such as inclusive classrooms, resource centers, or self-contained classrooms. Program completers are certified to teach students with disabilities in general education classrooms and/or resource centers/special class programs in the subject area(s) for which they earned their general education certification(s). This is a reduced tuition program. In all programs, a faculty advisor will work closely with candidates to monitor their program and course selections
