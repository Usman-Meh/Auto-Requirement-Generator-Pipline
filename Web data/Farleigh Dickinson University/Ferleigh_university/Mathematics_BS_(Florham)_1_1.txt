Statistician
Economist
Actuary
Cryptologist
Biostatistician
College Professor.
Program Learning Outcomes
At the completion of the program students will:
Have the ability to demonstrate an understanding of differentiation and integration techniques and how to use them in problem solving.
Have the ability to demonstrate an understanding of concepts and techniques in discrete mathematics, including logic, induction, recursion, graphs and Boolean algebra.
Have the ability to demonstrate an understanding of linear and Matrix Algebra and how to use them in solving problems which includes: Vector spaces and linear transformations; systems of linear equations, bases, matrix representations of linear transformations, matrix algebra, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, determinants, canonical forms, and inner product spaces.
Have the ability to demonstrate an understanding of solving problems using probabilistic models.
