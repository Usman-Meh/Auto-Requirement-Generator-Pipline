Health Studies BS
The
Bachelor of Science in Health Studies
Program is designed to prepare graduates with an understanding of a wide range of health-related concepts with a strong emphasis on problem-solving skills and critical thinking. The comprehensive curriculum provides a solid foundation of general education, health-related science and in-depth perspectives in health and healthcare delivery.
The program offers four concentrations – Science, General, Exercise Science, and Global Health – which are differentiated by several curricular elements. The “major” courses are identical across the concentrations, as are the Admission Requirements.  (Please note that not all program concentrations appear on the Common App. Please inquire at
myapp@fdu.edu
on enrolling in a major/concentration if you do not see it listed on your application.)

Curriculum
**Accuplacer reading/writing scores and math assessment scores will determine which reading/writing and math courses first time, first year students will take.  Those with reading/writing placement scores below the standards must complete courses in prerequisite skills (e.g., WRIT 1000, WRIT 1001, READ 1000). Those with math placement scores below the standards must complete courses in prerequisite skills (e.g., MATH 0298, MATH 1100).  These courses are applied toward free electives or are non-credit-bearing.
This requirement applies to all first time, first year students, even if they have been accepted into a Health Studies Program Track.
