Nursing BSN
The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program develops a student to become a professional nurse who is prepared to practice in many settings, across the lifespan, and with diverse populations, and whose practice is based upon nursing science and related arts and sciences. Graduates of the program are qualified for the role of a baccalaureate prepared generalist nurse as described by the
American Association of Colleges of Nursing
and are eligible to take the
NCLEX-RN
for licensure as a registered nurse.
Admission Requirements
Graduation from an accredited secondary school with a record indicating the potential to succeed in college.
Completion of the following high school studies:
4 units of English
1 unit of Chemistry + Lab
2 units of History
1 unit of Biology + Lab
2 units of college preparatory Mathematics
At least 16 high school academic units
GPA of 3.0 or higher
FDU Students Interested in Changing Major into the Nursing Program
Nursing curricula will begin in the fall semester of sophomore year for students who change their major to the nursing program. Students can apply/process the change of major form after meeting the following requirements:
Completion of all first-year courses in Sciences, Math, Writing, and University Core (see academic program plan below)
Cumulative GPA of 2.67 or higher
Repeat of any Science and Math course only once, and achievement of a grade of B-
NOTES
Science labs must have been taken in-person.
A 4-credit general chemistry or higher-level chemistry course, with in-person lab, and earned grade of B- or higher in both lecture and lab, can substitute for CHEM1107/1117.  Introduction to Chemistry is not a sufficient substitution.
Statistics course must include descriptive and inferential statistics. Introduction to Statistics is not a sufficient substitution. Course can be confirmed using
NJTransfer
against FDU benchmarks of PSYC2210, MATH2335/2337, or higher level.
Students must achieve a grade of C (74+) in all general education courses, electives, and major electives, to receive credit toward the BSN degree. Students who apply for change of major into the Nursing Program will not be deferred because of a lower grade in such courses (as long as other criteria are met) but will need to repeat the course to receive credit toward the degree.

Academic Program Plan
NURS didactic courses are routinely scheduled with weekly synchronous lecture or recitation sessions (including both Zoom and in-person synchronous sessions). Because of the volume of content in these courses, online accessibility to a recording is provided, where possible, so students can review the material.  Use of asynchronous attendance in lieu of synchronous attendance, as a primary strategy, is not advised. Rather, asynchronous viewing is for students who have an occasional academic conflict or are ill.
Optimal success is associated with synchronous attendance, when it is offered, in NURS didactic courses.
**Accuplacer reading/writing scores and math assessment scores will determine which reading/writing and math courses first time, first year students will take.  Those with reading/writing placement scores below the standards must complete courses in prerequisite skills (e.g., WRIT 1000, WRIT 1001, READ 1000). Those with math placement scores below the standards must complete courses in prerequisite skills (e.g., MATH 0298, MATH 1100).  These courses are applied toward free electives or are non-credit-bearing.
This requirement applies to all first time, first year students, even if they have been accepted into the BSN Program Track.
