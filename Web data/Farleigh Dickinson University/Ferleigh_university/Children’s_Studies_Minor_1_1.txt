Children’s Studies Minor
The children’s studies minor provides students with a multidisciplinary understanding of childhood in human society. Using the disciplinary perspectives of literature, psychology, sociology, and anthropology, the minor grounds students in an understanding of childhood as preparation for employment in child services and advocacy, or advanced study in the fields of education, literature, psychology, sociology, and anthropology.
