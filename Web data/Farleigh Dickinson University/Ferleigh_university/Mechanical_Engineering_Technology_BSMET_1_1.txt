Mechanical Engineering Technology BSMET
The Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering Technology curriculum requires the successful completion of 120 credits. It includes mathematics, basic sciences, English composition and communications, humanities and social sciences, and technical courses. The curriculum consists of an integrated sequence of undergraduate courses emphasizing the application of engineering and scientific knowledge, methods, technology and technical skills appropriate to the discipline.
The program prepares students to apply the principles of mechanics and energy to the design, manufacturing and operation of machinery and other mechanical devices. Employment opportunities for mechanical engineering technologists are in power generation, process control, production supervision, plant operation, manufacturing, quality assurance and reliability testing, test and field services, automotive industry, heating, ventilating and air conditioning.
Professional Accreditation
The B.S. in Mechanical Engineering Technology program is accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission of ABET,
https://www.abet.org
.
Educational Objectives
The educational objectives of the B.S. in Mechanical Engineering Technology program define the career and professional accomplishments that the graduates are being prepared to achieve three to four years after graduation. The program will produce graduates who:
Enter into and advance their careers in the analysis, applied design, development, implementation and management of mechanical systems and processes, including those used in fields such as mechanical design, electromechanical devices and controls, manufacturing processes or applied thermal-fluid sciences.
Continue their formal education leading to professional licensures or advanced degrees in science, technology or business.
Continue to conduct themselves as both responsible professionals and global citizens who are aware of and who understand ethical issues and societal needs and problems.
These objectives are consistent with the mission of Fairleigh Dickinson University to educate and prepare students as world citizens through global education. They also fulfill the needs of the program constituencies, which include students, alumni, employers, faculty, and the Industrial Advisory Board.
Student Outcomes
Each mechanical engineering technology graduate will demonstrate the following attributes and achievements as required by the ETAC of ABET upon or before graduation:
An ability to apply knowledge, techniques, skills and modern tools of mathematics, science, engineering, and technology to solve broadly-defined engineering problems appropriate to the discipline;
An ability to design systems, components, or processes meeting specified needs for broadly-defined engineering problems appropriate to the discipline;
An ability to apply written, oral, and graphical communication in broadly-defined technical and non-technical environments; and an ability to identify and use appropriate technical literature;
An ability to conduct standard tests, measurements, and experiments and to analyze and interpret the results to improve processes; and
An ability to function effectively as a member as well as a leader on technical teams.
Cooperative Education or Work Experience Option
Students in the B.S. in Mechanical Engineering Technology program have the option to undertake a cooperative education experience and earn a total of 6 academic credits toward their technical electives. The co-op experience provides students a real-world grounding, linking theory and practice, academic and industrial experiences, and college education and lifelong learning. It better prepares students for jobs, gives them a competitive edge in the job market, helps them develop networking skills and professional contacts and allows them to experience career fields before graduation. Industry benefits from better-prepared graduates with real and relevant work experience – saving time and money by reducing the training period for new employees.
Instead of undertaking cooperative education, students may earn up to 6 academic credits for appropriately documented industrial experience (Work Experience) counted toward their technical electives. Note that credits earned from industrial experience and/or cooperative education may not be substituted for any required course work and that they altogether may not exceed a total of six credits. Students must have successfully completed the course EGTG2210 Technical Communications before the application for “Work Experience” credits can be considered. The application form and directions for submission of necessary documents in support of the application may be obtained from the office of GHSCSE.
