Studio Arts Minor
The 15-credit minor in studio arts will prepare students in the fundamentals of two-dimensional and three-dimensional visual language, allowing them to express themselves in a range of methods and materials.
These courses instill in students the conceptual foundations for understanding the creative process as well as the technical skills to implement their ideas. Student art exhibitions and faculty-led trips to museums and galleries enrich the learning experience.
The minor is offered by the School of the Arts, Maxwell Becton College of Arts and Sciences, at the Florham Campus, Madison, New Jersey.
