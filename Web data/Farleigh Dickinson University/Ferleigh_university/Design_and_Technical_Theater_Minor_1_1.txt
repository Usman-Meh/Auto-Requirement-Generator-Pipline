Design and Technical Theater Minor
The 15-credit design and technical theater minor offers students interested in studying the design and technical aspects of theater a comprehensive exposure to relevant study with a focus on hands-on application. Minors are also encouraged to work on departmental productions in either of FDU’s two theaters, where students have a chance to work alongside professional guest artists. The department offers a number of design, stage management, and crew positions which reinforce all that students learn in the classroom. The minor is offered by the School of the Arts, Maxwell Becton College of Arts and Sciences, at the Florham Campus, Madison, New Jersey.
