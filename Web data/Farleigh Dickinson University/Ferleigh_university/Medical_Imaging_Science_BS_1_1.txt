Medical Imaging Science BS
Medical imagers are integral members of the healthcare team with knowledge and skills to understand and use technologies to examine various parts of the body to guide critical decisions in patient diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment planning.
Graduates who earn the
Bachelor of Science (BS) in Medical Imaging Science
can choose between one of two sonography concentrations and earn a degree that is awarded jointly between FDU and
Rutgers University
.
Graduates from this accredited program will be eligible for national certification and state licensure, where applicable. The
American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ARDMS)
is the organization responsible for administering the certification exam and maintaining the registry of certified sonographers. Certification in sonography is not a requirement for practice in all states, but many employers prefer or require certification as a way to ensure that their sonographers have met certain professional standards. Additionally, certification can provide sonographers with more job opportunities, higher salaries, and increased professional recognition.
Diagnostic Medical Sonography
Diagnostic medical sonographers provide patient services using diagnostic ultrasound under the supervision of a licensed physician, who is responsible for the interpretation of ultrasound images. Sonographers look for subtle differences between health and pathological areas and decide what images are significant in meeting the objectives of the study.
A minimum of 136 credits is required for graduation from this concentration.
After completion of 3 years of study at FDU (minimum 90 credits), students apply for acceptance into the Rutgers School of Health Professions. If accepted, the degree program is completed in 15 months at Rutgers University (additional 46 credits). Students will earn a Joint (FDU and Rutgers) BS Degree in Medical Imaging Science with Certificate/Concentration in Diagnostic Medical Sonography. See
Diagnostic Medical Sonography Program – Rutgers School of Health Professions
for additional information.
Cardiovascular Sonography
Cardiovascular sonographers (or “echocardiographers”) provide patient services using diagnostic ultrasound under the supervision of a licensed physician, who is responsible for the interpretation of ultrasound images.  Cardiovascular sonographers are
specially trained to use imaging technology to support diagnosis and monitoring of heart problems in patients
.
Among other skills, they operate ultrasound equipment that provides moving 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional images of the heart and its chambers.
A minimum of 140 credits is required for graduation from this concentration.
After completion of 3 years of study at FDU (minimum 90 credits), students apply for acceptance into the Rutgers School of Health Professions.  If accepted, the program is completed in 15 months at Rutgers University (additional 50 credits). Students will earn a Joint (FDU and Rutgers) BS Degree in Medical Imaging Science with Certificate/Concentration in Cardiovascular Sonography. See
Cardiac Sonography Program – Rutgers School of Health Professions
for additional information.
Admission Requirements
Graduates from an accredited secondary school with a record indicating the potential to succeed in college
will be considered for admission to the FDU BS in Medical Imaging Science
.
Completion of the following high school studies:
4 units of English
1 unit of Chemistry + Lab
2 units of History
1 unit of Biology + Lab
2 units of college preparatory Mathematics
At least 16 high school academic units
Secondary school GPA of 2.7 or higher
Admission to Rutgers School of Health Professions
Students will submit a separate application in the fall semester of their sophomore year (second semester of year 2 at FDU).
Admission decisions to Rutgers are made in accordance with criteria, policies and procedures established by a joint committee and cannot be guaranteed by FDU.
Students generally
need to demonstrate at least a 2.85 GPA
in major and prerequisite courses at FDU to be considered for admission to the Rutgers Medical Imaging Science program. Specific prerequisite courses must be completed with a grade of B minus or higher.
Curriculum
(Updated for Fall 2024)
A minimum of 136 credits (Diagnostic Medical Sonography concentration) or 140 credits (Cardiovascular Sonography concentration) is required to graduate from this degree program.
After completion of 3 years of study at FDU (minimum 90 credits, of which 40 are GenEd and 50 are courses in the major), students apply for acceptance into the Rutgers School of Health Professions.  If accepted, the program is completed in 15 months at Rutgers University (additional 46 credits for Diagnostic Medical Sonography concentration; additional 50 credits for Cardiovascular Sonography concentration).
**Accuplacer reading/writing scores and math assessment scores will determine which reading/writing and math courses first time, first year students will take.  Those with reading/writing placement scores below the standards must complete courses in prerequisite skills (e.g., WRIT 1000, WRIT 1001, READ 1000). Those with math placement scores below the standards must complete courses in prerequisite skills (e.g., MATH 0298, MATH 1100).  These courses are applied toward free electives or are non-credit-bearing.
This requirement applies to all first time, first year students, even if they have been accepted into this program track.
