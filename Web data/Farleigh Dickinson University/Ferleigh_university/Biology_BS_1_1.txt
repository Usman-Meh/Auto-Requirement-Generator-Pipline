Biology BS
This curriculum is designed for students who plan to attend graduate school and for pre professional students who wish to prepare for admission to a school of chiropractic, dentistry, medicine, osteopathy, pharmacy, podiatry, or veterinary medicine.
Students should consult the catalog of the school they plan to attend in order to include in their undergraduate programs any special prerequisites not included in the biology curriculum. The pre professional adviser helps students prepare for entrance into their desired professions.
It should be noted that the majority of the students accepted to graduate schools have completed four years of undergraduate work.
Program Outcomes
Students majoring in Biology develop the following skills and abilities:
Ability to use the scientific method and understand its strengths and weaknesses:
Clearly states a hypothesis; Identifies not only the basics of the issue, but recognizes the nuances of the issue.
Ability to research a biological topic using traditional and computer technology:
Provides a thorough and relevant literature review; Considers alternate ways to approach the questions; Ability to read and evaluate professional scientific literature; Demonstrates understanding of the relationship between experiment and theory.
Ability to write and communicate science:
Writing enhances the presentation; Writing is consistently well written; Writing communicates clearly using the language of biology; Writing displays an excellent command of writing mechanics; Topics are clearly organized; Topics are covered in-depth; Topics display an abundance of original ideas; APA style is used consistently and accurately without any errors.
Ability to utilize mathematical reasoning and quantitative skills in biology:
Analyzes data via graphs, statistics and curve fitting as appropriate; Possess observational and technical skills; Carries out controlled experiments using the proper equipment and safety measurements; Identifies relevant constraints; Collects data carefully and with appropriate precision; Uses initial data to refine the experiment.
Possess major field knowledge:
Identifies an appropriate question by using prior knowledge; Ability to successfully compete in biologically related fields; Obtains acceptance into graduate/professional schools or employment in the field.
Degree Plan
NOTE: All students are required to complete the General Education Requirements in fulfillment of their Bachelor degree requirements.
Florham Campus students are required to take
SPCH 1107
Fundamentals of Speech and
PHIL1440
Bio-Medical Ethics as part of their general education requirements.
During semesters 4 and 5 the Florham students will take Molecular Cell Biology before Genetics and Metro students will take Genetics before Molecular Cell Biology]
Florham campus students take Applied Statistics (MATH 1133) and Metropolitan campus students take Experimental Design (BIOL 2300)
General Physics I and II can be taken with or without calculus on both New Jersey campuses
Marine Biology can satisfy Ecology requirement on the Metropolitan campus only
Biochemistry lecture (without lab) can count towards a chemistry minor as an elective and may be a requirement in certain tracks on both New Jersey campuses
Ethics in Science can count for the Moral/Ethics requirement on the Metropolitan campus only
