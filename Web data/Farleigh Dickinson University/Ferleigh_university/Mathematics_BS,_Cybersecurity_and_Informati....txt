Mathematics BS, Cybersecurity and Information Assurance MS 4 Plus 1 Program
The Lee Gildart and Oswald Haase School of Computer Sciences and Engineering (GHSCSE) offers a 4 Plus 1 program that allows qualified students to earn a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in mathematics with a pathway to the Master of Science (M.S.) degree in cybersecurity and information assurance. In particular, three graduate courses:
CSCI6731
Computer Networks (3 credits),
CSCI6738
Cybersecurity (3 credits) and
CSCI6747
Applied Cryptography (3 credits), when successfully completed under the 4 Plus 1 program, can be credited toward both the B.S. and the M.S. degrees. This 4 Plus 1 program is offered by GHSCSE at the Metropolitan Campus, Teaneck, New Jersey.
Degree Plan
The B.S. in mathematics program has two concentrations: pure mathematics and applied mathematics. The curricula for the combined dual-degree program with the two concentrations are described below.
