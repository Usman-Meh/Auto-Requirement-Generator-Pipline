Mathematics BS, Computer Science MS 4 Plus 1 Program
The Lee Gildart and Oswald Haase School of Computer Sciences and Engineering (GHSCSE) offers a 4 Plus 1 program that allows qualified students to earn a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in mathematics with a pathway to the Master of Science (M.S.) degree. In particular, three graduate courses:
CSCI6603
Computer Architecture (3 credits),
CSCI6623
Database Systems (3 credits) and
CSCI6638
Operating Systems (3 credits), when successfully completed under theÂ 4 Plus 1 program, can be credited toward both the B.S. and the M.S. degrees. This combined dual-degree program is offered by GHSCSE at the Metropolitan Campus, Teaneck, New Jersey.
Degree Plan
The B.S. in mathematics program has two concentrations: pure mathematics, applied mathematics .The curricula for the 4 Plus 1 program with the two concentrations are described below.
