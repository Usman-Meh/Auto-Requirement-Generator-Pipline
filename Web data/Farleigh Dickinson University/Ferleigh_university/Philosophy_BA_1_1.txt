Philosophy BA
As the traditional liberal arts discipline that emphasizes questioning, reasoning, and inquiring into all human values, Philosophy provides a rich undergraduate major that can lead students to a variety of career choices. Because students of philosophy develop high degrees of critical thinking skills, they may pursue careers in law, business, and other fields as well as in the traditional career paths for philosophy students in teaching and research.
