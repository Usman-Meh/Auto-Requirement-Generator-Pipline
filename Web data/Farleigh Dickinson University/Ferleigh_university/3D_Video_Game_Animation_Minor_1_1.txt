3D Video Game Animation Minor
With the Advancement of 3D accelerated graphics, video games now go far beyond the sprite-based 2D graphics to display visuals that are more realistic and lifelike. In the 15-credit 3D Video Game Animation minor, students learn how to create optimized 3D graphics and animations that will respond well for the player, and then apply interactivity to those pieces using industry-standard game creation platforms. Both first-person (rendered from the perspective of the player’s character) and third-person (shown from a distance away from the player’s character) games are explored.
