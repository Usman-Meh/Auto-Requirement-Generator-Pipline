Nursing BSN Accelerated
The Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing (ABSN) program welcomes individuals who have baccalaureate degrees in fields other than nursing. The program honors diverse academic and life experiences and provides an opportunity to enter the nursing profession in a concentrated 15-month timeframe. Graduates of the program are qualified for the role of baccalaureate-prepared generalist nurse as described by the
American Association of Colleges of Nursing
and are eligible to take the
NCLEX-RN
for licensure as a registered nurse (RN).
ABSN students need 120 credits needed to earn the BSN degree. Students will receive 45 general education (“GenEd”) credits from their prior degree applied towards the BSN. In addition, students will receive 19 credits for completing the program prerequisite courses. There are 56 additional credits of coursework in the ABSN program needed to earn the BSN degree. Prior learning credit for other courses, such as to fulfill the major (NURS or MEDT) elective and other MEDT course requirements, will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Admissions to the ABSN program are on a rolling basis. Students begin as a cohort in Summer. If you have completed a baccalaureate degree program and are seeking to become an RN, please also consider our
Nursing MSN Entry-to-Practice
program which offers admissions on a rolling basis, with students able to begin in Fall, Spring, or Summer.
