African-American Studies Minor
The minor in African-American studies exposes students to a program of study concerning African-American culture, life, and history in the United States. By exposing students to an interdisciplinary study of African Americans (encompassing history, sociology, literature, cinema, and anthropology), the minor is intended to educate students on how African-Americans helped shape American history and culture and continue to transform it today. The minor also emphasizes the relevance of Africa in understanding the attitudes, circumstances, and experiences of African-Americans. The core course, AFAM 1100 Introduction to African-American Studies, will ground students in the fundamentals of interdisciplinary study. In the electives, the students will learn that the African-American experience is not only an integral part of the United States experience but also integral to understanding the world at large.
