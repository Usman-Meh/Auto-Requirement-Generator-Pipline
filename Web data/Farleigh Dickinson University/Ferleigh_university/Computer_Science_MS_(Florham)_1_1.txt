Computer Science MS (Florham)
The graduate program in computer science prepares students for the direct pursuit of productive careers in industry and for continued graduate study. The program’s orientation is toward educating professionals to become leaders in various areas of computer science ranging from software engineering to computer design, and from systems analysis to the management of information systems. The program is offered by Gildart Haase School of Computer Sciences and Engineering at the Florham Campus in collaboration with the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of Becton College.
Gildart Haase School of Computer Science and Engineering is the overall initiator of the MSCS programs at FDU and supports the programs on both campuses. Both programs require students to complete the same 15-credit elective coursework. GHSCSE offers a broader spectrum of Elective courses at the Metro campus, enabling students more options for specialization.
