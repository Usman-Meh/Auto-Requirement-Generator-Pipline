Screenwriting and Dramatic Writing Minor
The 15-credit screenwriting/dramatic writing minor is designed for students interested in studying the art and craft of writing for the screen and/or stage. The rationale for the required courses for this minor is that knowledge of all forms of creative and dramatic writing contribute to each other and are necessary for a student to become a well-rounded writer no matter what the format. The most talented, acclaimed, and successful screenwriters and playwrights often cross genres.
