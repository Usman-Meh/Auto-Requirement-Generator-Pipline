Program Highlights
Students in this program receive a dual degree: major in Information Technology and minor in Business Administration.
The program serves as an ideal launch pad for a management career in any technology-oriented company that is heavily dependent upon Information Technology.
Courses from different fields of engineering are included: Computer Hardware, Software Programming, Web Design, Database Design, Networking Analysis, Digital Design, and Cyber Security.
Courses have embedded content for industry certifications like CompTIA A+, CompTIA Network+ and CompTIA Security+.
Program Objectives
The main objective of the B.S. in Information Technology is to produce graduates who:
Enter into and advance in the profession of information technology, management information systems, business administration, or other related fields.
Continue their education by obtaining professional certificates or advanced degrees in information technology, management information systems, business administration, or other related fields.
Continue to conduct themselves as both responsible professionals and global citizens, who are aware of ethical issues and societal needs and problems.
The program objectives define the skills, knowledge, and attributes that graduates are expected to possess three to four years following graduation, and they fulfill the needs of our several University constituencies, including alumni, students, the Industrial Advisory Committee, the faculty, and employers. These objectives are consistent with the mission of Fairleigh Dickinson University “to educate and prepare students as world citizens through global education.”
Student Outcomes
The B.S. in Information Technology program has adopted the Student Outcomes of the Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) of ABET as its own learning outcomes, which define the attributes, skills, and knowledge that the graduates are expected to possess upon or before graduation. Each Information Technology graduate will demonstrate the following attributes and achievements as required by the CAC of ABET by the time of graduation:
Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
