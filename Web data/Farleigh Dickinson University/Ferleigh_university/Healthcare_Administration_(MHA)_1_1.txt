Healthcare Administration (MHA)
The management degree for leadership in the healthcare sector.
This program is designed for individuals working in the healthcare industry who wish to advance their careers in administration to become:
Directors
Senior Managers
Chief Officers
Fairleigh Dickinson University’s history is rooted in the healthcare industry, with its namesakes Fairleigh S. Dickinson and Maxwell Becton having founded a regional pharmaceutical and medical technology company.  It is one of only two degree-granting pharmacy schools in New Jersey and is the first in the state to be associated with a private university. FDU retains long-term working relationships with New Jersey healthcare organizations that welcome FDU pharmaceutical, public health, nursing, MBA health services, and MPA healthcare management students and graduates.
The MHA program was developed in consultation with and is taught by leaders and industry partners in the field of healthcare management.  The program focuses on both practical and theoretical aspects of healthcare administration, including law, ethics, and policy for health and human services; finance and accounting; organizational and risk communications; technology; and human resources.
Program Goals
Provide masters-level studies for working adults in preparation for, or to advance in
healthcare administration
Develop leadership skills essential for healthcare administration
Establish a strong intellectual foundation in the core areas of healthcare administration
Expose students to current topics within the field of healthcare administration
Develop research abilities and analytical skills
Provide an immersive experience
Encourage the development of innovative best practices.
The MHA program is enriched with a project-based curriculum. The project-based coursework emphasizes group work, problem-solving, and building a portfolio of accomplishments. It integrates accomplished practitioners with accomplished academics to give you the best of both worlds. Students are asked to work together to offer recommendations, map solutions, and collaborate on research.
Our traditional weeknight program is offered at Metropolitan Campus (Teaneck) and in all modalities including Zoom, asynchronous online, and hybrid.
