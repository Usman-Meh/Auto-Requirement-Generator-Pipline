Mechanical Engineering BSME
Mechanical engineering is one of the largest, broadest, and most diverse engineering disciplines. The Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (BSME) degree program prepares graduates for entrance into the profession of mechanical engineering or graduate study. The program graduates will work in industry as mechanical engineers, typically specializing as machine design engineers, manufacturing engineers, power engineers, electromechanical engineers, or automotive engineers.
The BSME curriculum provides students with a varied and balanced educational experience through an appropriate combination of theoretical concepts and practical applications. The program focuses on four key areas of mechanical engineering: mechanical design, electromechanical devices and controls, advanced manufacturing, and thermal sciences. Students will learn to analyze, design, build, test, operate, and maintain mechanical components, devices, systems, processes, and facilities; estimate costs; and manage projects.
Professional Accreditation
The BS in Mechanical Engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET,
https://www.abet.org
.
Educational Objectives
The educational objectives of the B.S. in Mechanical Engineering program define the career and professional accomplishments that the graduates are being prepared to achieve three to four years after graduation. The program will produce graduates who:
Enter into and advance in the profession of mechanical engineering, particularly in the areas of mechanical design, electromechanical devices and controls, advanced manufacturing and thermal-fluid sciences.
Continue their formal education and obtain advanced degrees such as M.S. degree in mechanical engineering or other related fields.
Become responsible professionals and global citizens who are aware of ethical issues and societal needs and problems.
These objectives are consistent with the mission of Fairleigh Dickinson University to educate and prepare students as world citizens through global education. They also fulfill the needs of the program constituencies, which include students, alumni, employers, faculty and the Industrial Advisory Board.
Student Outcomes
The B.S. in Mechanical Engineering program has adopted the student outcomes of the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET as its own student outcomes, which define the attributes, skills and knowledge that the graduates are expected to possess upon or before graduation. Each mechanical engineering graduate will demonstrate the following attributes and achievements as required by the EAC of ABET upon or before graduation:
An ability to identify, formulate and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science and mathematics.
An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.
An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.
An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental and societal contexts.
An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.
An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions.
An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.
Cooperative Education Option
Students in the B.S.M.E. program have the option to undertake a cooperative education experience and earn a total of 6 academic credits toward their technical electives. Note that these credits may not be substituted for any required course work. The co-op experience provides students a real-world grounding, linking theory and practice, academic and industrial experiences, and college education and lifelong learning. It better prepares students for jobs, gives them a competitive edge in the job market, helps them develop networking skills and professional contacts and allows them to experience career fields before graduation. Industry benefits from better-prepared graduates with real and relevant work experience – saving time and money by reducing the training period for new employees.
