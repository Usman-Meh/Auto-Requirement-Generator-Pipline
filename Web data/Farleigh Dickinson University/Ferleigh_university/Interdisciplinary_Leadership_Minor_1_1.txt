Interdisciplinary Leadership Minor
The minor combines theory and practice. The minor helps students develop skills they need for leading people and organizations, and for reassessing, growing, and adapting their leadership style and philosophy as they work with different groups, institutions, and professional settings over the course of their careers and lives. Our minor is interdisciplinary and supplements the intellectual depth our students acquire in a major field by giving them a knowledge base concerning leadership so they can project and deploy their liberal arts academic training through work, civic engagement, and personal life.
