Chemistry BS
The BS in Chemistry is the primary degree for entry into the chemical and pharmaceutical industry and also for graduate programs in chemistry, biochemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry, biomedical engineering, and many other areas. This degree is especially suitable for potential applicants to professional schools in medicine, pharmacy, and veterinary medicine. Premed students usually take the MCAT exam in their junior years after completing organic chemistry. The curriculum is certified by the
American Chemical Society
(Florham).
Program Outcomes for BS Chemistry
Students majoring in Biology develop the following skills and abilities:
Demonstrate a solid foundation in chemistry including the vocabulary, concepts, methods, and procedures that will allow them to be competitive when entering industry, graduate, and professional schools.
Write and speak clearly on chemical topics and demonstrate a mastery of these topics through their written and oral communications.
Excel at utilizing information resources including primary and secondary literature in the field using modern tools to locate and retrieve scientific information.
Demonstrate qualitative and quantitative critical reasoning skills allowing them to interpret experimental data and evaluate its significance.
Use standard laboratory equipment, modern instrumentation, and classical techniques to carry out experiments while following proper procedures and regulations for safe handling and use of chemicals and equipment.
