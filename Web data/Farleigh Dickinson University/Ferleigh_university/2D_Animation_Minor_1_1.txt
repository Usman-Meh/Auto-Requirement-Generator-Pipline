2D Animation Minor
2D animation is the art of creating movement using individual graphics that are sequenced together over time. 2D animators tell stories and communicate ideas by making characters, objects, and backgrounds move in two-dimensional space in a way that engages the audience. This style of animation is commonly seen in TV shows, video games, films, commercials, apps, and websites. Our 2D Animation minor focuses on the digital aspects of 2D animation, including frame-by-frame motion, tweening, and motion graphics.
