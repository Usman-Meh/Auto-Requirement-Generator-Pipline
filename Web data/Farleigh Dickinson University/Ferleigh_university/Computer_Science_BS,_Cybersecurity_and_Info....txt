Computer Science BS, Cybersecurity and Information Assurance MS 4 Plus 1 Program
The Lee Gildart and Oswald Haase School of Computer Sciences and Engineering (GHSCSE) offers a 4 Plus 1 program for a BS in Computer Science with a pathway to the MS in Cybersecurity Information Assurance. Three graduate courses: CSCI6623 Database Systems (3 credits), CSCI6638 Operating Systems (3 credits), and CSCI6731 Computer Networks (3 credits), when successfully completed under the 4 Plus 1 program, can be credited toward both the B.S. and the M.S. degrees. Students must take one of the three concentrations: big data analytics, cybersecurity and information assurance, and mobile and game app development in the B.S. in computer science program. This combined degree program is offered by GHSCSE at the Metropolitan Campus, Teaneck, New Jersey.
Special Information
Professional Accreditation and Other Designation
The B.S. in computer science program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET,
https://www.abet.org
. This accreditation applies only to the B.S. in computer science program offered by the Lee Gildart and Oswald Haase School of Computer Sciences and Engineering at the Metropolitan Campus, Teaneck, NJ.
Students completing the B.S. in computer science program with a concentration in cybersecurity and information assurance are eligible to receive a Certificate of Completion of a National Security Agency (NSA) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS)-designated CAE-CDE program of study from FDUâ€™s Center for Cybersecurity and Information Assurance (CCIA).
Cooperative Education Option
Students in the B.S. in computer science program have the option to undertake a cooperative education experience and earn a total of 6 academic credits toward their technical electives.
Admission Requirements
Students must register for this program upon completing at least 45 credits and must have achieved a cumulative grade point ratio (CGPR) of at least 2.75.
A minimum of 120 credits is required for the B.S. in computer science degree, and a minimum of 141 of credits is required for the combined B.S. in computer science/M.S. in cybersecurity and information assurance
In addition, for degree completion, the B.S. in computer science degree requires a minimum CGPA of 2.0; the M.S. in cybersecurity and information assurance, 2.75
