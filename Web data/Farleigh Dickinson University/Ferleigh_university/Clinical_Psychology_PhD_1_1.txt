Internship and dissertation
Students are required to apply for internship via the national match system offered by the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC) and participate in an approved internship. The internship may begin after the student has completed the courses listed under the first six semesters, completed the second year research project, passed the comprehensive examinations, and successfully defended the dissertation proposal. Typically, the dissertation is completed in the fourth year and the internship in the fifth year.
Evaluations
Ongoing annual evaluations of students will be conducted by the faculty using information submitted by practicum site supervisors, course instructors, and research mentors. Students will meet with the Program Director to receive feedback concerning these evaluations.
Research practicum
All first-, second- and third-year students participate in a research practicum of ongoing projects supervised by doctoral faculty members. The practicum requires approximately 8-10 hours a week. Research projects frequently culminate in the publication of articles in psychological journals and paper and poster presentations at various professional meetings, with students in the doctoral program participating as authors and presenters.
Forensic Track
An optional add-on forensic track is available to students in the Ph.D. program who fulfill the following additional requirements:
Completion of at least one of the required clinical practicums at any point after the first year. This requirement can be satisfied through an NYNJDOT approved externship or similar placement meeting requirements of the track.
Completion of at least two additional courses: PSYC7230 Forensic Assessment and Prediction and PSYC7235 Evaluating Criminal Responsibility and Competency.
Completion of a dissertation on a forensic topic.
It should be noted that research opportunities in forensic psychology are available.
Forensic track courses may incur additional fees if they increase a student’s credit load for a given semester above the allowable flat fee level of 16.5 credits.
Students coming into the program without a Master’s degree may incur additional fees for the two courses mentioned above since they are above and beyond the required courses for the clinical doctoral program.
Completion of the forensic track will be noted on the student’s transcript.
