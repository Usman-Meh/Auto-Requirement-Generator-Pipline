Acting Minor
The Acting Minor offers a foundation in the diverse aspects of contemporary theater. The minor focuses on a collaborative approach to theatrical production, allowing students to study both the practical and academic aspects of the discipline. Minors are also encouraged to audition for or to crew departmental productions in either of FDU’s two theaters: Dreyfuss Theater and the Barn Theater. Between these spaces, the School of the Arts mounts a full season of musicals, classics, and contemporary productions each year, providing opportunities for hands-on application of classroom learning.
The acting minor is offered by the School of the Arts, Maxwell Becton College of Arts and Sciences, at the Florham Campus, Madison, New Jersey.
