Humanities Minor
The 15-credit Humanities minor takes an interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary approach, drawing from the traditional Humanities disciplines — Philosophy, History, Literature — and the theoretical Arts. The student minoring in Humanities will acquire comprehensive knowledge about influential ideas and worldviews, theories, and methodologies; thorough understanding of historical trends; and discernment of overarching connections across viewpoints, cultures, and historical periods. The skills cultivated and reinforced by the Minor include reading comprehension of demanding and intricate texts; critical thinking and problem-solving; ability to locate events and developments in space and time, and to trace historical changes and interconnections of theoretical outlooks; aesthetic appreciation of works of art.
