3D Animation Minor
3D animation is the process of creating the illusion of motion in 3D space through the use of a variety of techniques. Though this digital imagery is presented on 2-dimensional screens, these animations are created to imitate 3D worlds. Thus, the 15-credit minor in 3D Animation prepares students to understand various types of digital 3D computer animation and their uses in virtual worlds. The flexibility of this minor allows students to target their area of interest whether it is 3D modeling, commercial animation, or 3D character animation.
