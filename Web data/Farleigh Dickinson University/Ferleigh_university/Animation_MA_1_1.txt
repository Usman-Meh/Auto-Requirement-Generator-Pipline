Grow Your Skills
GRADUATE PROGRAM
Our Mission
Our 36-credit Master of Arts degree in Animation offers three concentrations (
3D Character Animation, Visual Effects, Video Games
) that center around gaining hands-on skills in the chosen concentration. This major is designed for students who possess an undergraduate degree from an accredited university, college, or art school who are looking to further sharpen their skills and increase their understanding of the discipline. It accepts recent undergraduates, master’s level transfer students, and working professionals who want to grow their animation skills.
About the Degree
All of the courses in this program are offered in a hybrid format, which allows students to decide if they would like to
attend classes in-residence, remotely online, or a combination of the two
. If you live locally, some weeks you may want to be in our state-of-the-art Animation Lab with the Professor while other weeks you may opt to join remotely to work around personal or family obligations. Whether you live near or across the globe, you can be in our Animation Master’s program and attend your classes in whichever way works best for you.
Special Admissions Instructions:
MA in Animation degree applicants must digitally submit a portfolio of 10-15 creative pieces as part of the application process. Acceptance is based on the quality of the work as well as meeting all of the other academic admission requirements of the university. The review committee is looking for work that is original in concept and content and will evaluate the portfolios to determine if the applicant qualifies to enter the program based on their artistic skills. If the submitted work infringes on copyright laws or is copied from other sources the applicant will be denied admission.
F-1 visa holders must attend all courses in-residence on a full-time basis.
Flexible Degree Paths
New enrollees can apply to begin in the Fall or Spring semester. Full-time students can complete this program in 1.5-2 years. Part-time students may take courses over multiple years until the required 36 credits are completed.
