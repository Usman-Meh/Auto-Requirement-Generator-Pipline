FACULTY AND STAFF

A program for rising diplomatic staff.
The Master of Arts in Global Affairs offers an intensive examination of our complex economic, political and social world issues, with in-depth perspectives on today’s political and global economy, international problems and conflict resolution.
Our program is distinguished by both its faculty and students. Our students come from around the globe, working primarily in consulates or diplomatic missions. In addition to FDU faculty, key professors include former United Nations Ambassadors, Consuls General and other outstanding professionals and academics who hold small, in-person classes.
The M.A. Global Affairs comprises 30 credits (10 courses) of graduate-level coursework held off-campus primarily in consulates and missions to the United Nations in New York City. Students typically take six credits per quarter and complete the program in two to three years. Courses begin in September, January, May, and July.
Building Blocks to a Full Degree
The program is tailored to the mobility needs of the diplomatic corps, with progressive stages to complete the M.A. degree, and online courses to accelerate or to complete the program if students are re-posted out of the area:
Diplomado (6 credits) for special cohorts
Certificate in Diplomacy and International Relations (18 credits)
Master of Arts in Global Affairs (30 credits)
The program may be taken from abroad completely online or by live tie-in to the classes in New York City.
Admission requirements
The credentials required for admission to the Master of Arts degree in Global Affairs as a matriculated student include the following:
