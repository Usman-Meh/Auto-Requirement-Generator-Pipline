Allied Health Technology BS (Radiologic Technology concentration)
Radiologic (“X-ray”) Technologists are the medical personnel who perform diagnostic imaging examinations. Radiologic Technologists provide services in hospitals, clinics, and imaging centers. At the completion of the Radiologic Technology five-year Bachelor of Science Program, students will be prepared for a career as a Radiologic Technologist. All programs prepare students to carry out traditional X-ray imaging, and some also prepare students to perform bone densitometry and inject contrast media. Graduates can also pursue additional post-graduate training to obtain a specialization certificate, such as for computed tomography (CT), mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), medical dosimetry, nuclear medicine, or diagnostic radiography.
Employment rate in various healthcare agencies in the tri-state area: 100%.
Salary and benefits after licensure:  >$75,000/year plus benefits package including health and dental care.
The
BS in Allied Health Technology/Radiologic Technology Concentration
is a five-year Bachelor of Science degree program. This “3 + 2” format provides an appropriate pace to succeed academically and develop strong clinical skills so that they are confident embarking on their careers. This program requires that students complete 90 credits at FDU (approximately 3 years), and then enroll and successfully complete an accredited
Joint Review Committee in Education in Radiologic Technology
(JRCERT) hospital certificate program. The JRCERT hospital certificate program, which includes a large proportion of hands-on experience, is approximately 2 years (18-24 months) in length.
Several JRCERT hospital certificate program options are available to FDU students through our numerous articulation agreements. JRCERT programs are independent of FDU (i.e., requires separate application and acceptance is not guaranteed by FDU). Financial aid is also not available through FDU when attending the JRCERT program, however many JRCERT programs offer their own financial aid. Tuition is paid directly to the JRCERT program during this phase of study.  Students will consult with their advisor during their first year to identify an appropriate JRCERT program for completing the hospital-based component of this degree program.

Curriculum
(Updated for Fall 2024)
A minimum of 120 credits is required for graduation from the FDU BS in Allied Health Technology degree program.
After completion of 3 years of study at FDU (minimum 90 credits, of which 40 are GenEd, 20 are courses in the major, and 30 are courses in the Radiologic Technology concentration), the program is completed in 24 months at a JCERT Accredited Hospital Program (additional 30 credits).
**Accuplacer reading/writing scores and math assessment scores will determine which reading/writing and math courses first time, first year students will take.  Those with reading/writing placement scores below the standards must complete courses in prerequisite skills (e.g., WRIT 1000, WRIT 1001, READ 1000). Those with math placement scores below the standards must complete courses in prerequisite skills (e.g., MATH 0298, MATH 1100).  These courses are applied toward free electives or are non-credit-bearing.
This requirement applies to all first time, first year students, even if they have been accepted into this program track.
