British Studies Minor
The British Studies Minor is designed to offer FDU students from Becton College, Silberman College of Business, and the independent professional schools who attend Wroxton College for a full fall or spring semester the opportunity to earn a minor that recognizes that immersive academic experience at Wroxton College.
The British Studies Minor also recognizes that students may accrue 15 credits of British-centered courses during short-term winter or summer programs at Wroxton College coupled with courses taken at Becton College in New Jersey. These approved courses are noted below. One can also use an authorized substitute course from another winter or summer course at Wroxton and from another fall or spring course at Becton.
Wroxton Fall/Spring Semester Courses
Choose any 15 credits taken during the fall or spring semester at Wroxton College to fulfill the 15-credit minor.
Wroxton Winter/Summer Session Courses
Choose from the following courses. The Communications course is offered every summer at Wroxton, while the Criminology course is offered every other summer at Wroxton. The three History courses are part of a summer program offered together every even year with a week of class sessions at Becton Florham followed by two weeks at Wroxton that include site tours in England and France (among other neighboring countries).
