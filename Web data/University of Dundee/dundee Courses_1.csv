Students develop a strong foundation in the scientific principles underlying dental practice, alongside practical clinical experience. The curriculum features interactive and creative learning methods, supported by an emphasis on patient care and communication skills.  Students work with Thiel cadavers for anatomical study and have opportunities for research projects, including summer internships and participation in the Dental Wiki project.  A Discovery Week allows exploration of chosen topics, potentially leading to elective studies, including international experiences.  The program is highly regarded, achieving top rankings nationally in student satisfaction and overall program quality.","The five-year curriculum integrates theoretical learning and hands-on clinical practice.  Year one focuses on foundational scientific principles and early patient interaction. Subsequent years progressively build upon this foundation, introducing advanced clinical techniques and specialized dental disciplines.  Opportunities for research involvement and elective studies are incorporated throughout the program to foster independent learning and exploration of specific dental interests.  The structure ensures a coherent progression from foundational sciences to complex clinical applications, preparing graduates for immediate entry into dental careers.","The first year establishes a strong basis in biological and chemical sciences relevant to dentistry, including human biology and chemistry.  Students also receive an introduction to basic dental procedures and principles of patient communication and care.

The fundamentals of the sciences that underpin dentistry and how they apply to clinical situations are also taught in the first year.","Building upon the first-year foundation, the second year delves deeper into dental anatomy, physiology, and pathology.  Students begin more advanced clinical training, gaining experience in various dental treatments, including restorative procedures and oral surgery techniques.  Emphasis is placed on practical skills development and refined patient interaction, preparing students for more complex patient care in subsequent years.","Year three focuses on more specialized areas of dentistry such as periodontics, endodontics, and prosthodontics.  Advanced clinical skills are further developed to increase the capability and efficiency of the students in handling the cases and patients. Increased responsibility in managing patients and performing complex procedures is expected from the students in this year. More lectures are also held in this year than the first two years.","During the fourth year, the curriculum expands to encompass areas such as orthodontics, oral medicine, and oral radiology. Students participate in more complex clinical cases under the supervision of experienced dentists. This year is when the students begin to actually work and gain experience in the different departments of the dental hospital. By the end of this year, the students will have the relevant professional skills and knowledge required to become dentists.","The final year provides comprehensive clinical experience, allowing students to manage patients independently while still under the supervision of senior clinicians.  Students will consolidate their knowledge and skills, developing the professionalism and confidence to work autonomously upon graduation. This year consists mainly of the students working and gaining experience in various clinical settings and working with the patients under guidance and supervision. This year aims to increase the confidence and practical skills of the students.",NA,Dentist,Dental Surgeon,Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon,Dental Hygienist,Dental Public Health Officer
