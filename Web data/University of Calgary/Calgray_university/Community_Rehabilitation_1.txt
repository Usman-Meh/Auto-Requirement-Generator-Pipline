Why choose Community Rehabilitation?
Community Rehabilitation and Disability Studies scholars ask questions such as: How can families affected by chronic health concerns participate fully in their communities? Do stigmas associated with disabilities influence social policy? How can society adapt to the needs of people with disabilities?
Community Rehabilitation and Disability Studies examines the economic, social and political forces that serve to marginalize people. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in class and through practical supervised field education. You’ll learn to design, deliver and evaluate community-based support services and how to form alliances that promote full participation in the community.
Career opportunities
​Community Rehabilitation and Disability Studies graduates have opportunities to work in areas such as career development, aging, brain injury, physical disability, inclusive education, research and more. A degree in Community Rehabilitation can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or a professional degree such as medicine, speech and language pathology, or physical therapy.
Courses in this program
Disability in Theory and Everyday Life, Introduction to Community Rehabilitation, The Organization and Diversity of Life, ​Introduction to Disability Studies

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
​I think the social discrimination experienced by people labelled as impaired stems from the fact that we expect people to have certain abilities. For 30 years I have studied this discrimination from an advocacy and academic angle. What we do in BCR is widely applicable to the social realities of many marginalized groups. Through hands-on experience, opportunities to research/be published, our students are positioned to make a real difference; as knowledge translators they empower communities.
