Program overview
Formed in 1963, the Department of Geoscience - Canada's largest - is a vibrant cornerstone of the University of Calgary. The program is a wellspring of Canada's geoscience research and industry professionals, with close ties to the resource industry that has established Alberta's reputation as a global energy leader. Many students participate in field schools during their program, and benefit from working on the doorstep of a fantastic geological laboratory: the Rocky Mountains. Our vision is an improved understanding of Earth systems through innovative and impactful geoscience research, interdisciplinary learning and discovery, empowered and inspired teaching, and effective communication that not only raises our profile as a geoscience centre of excellence, but also creates a brighter future for our world.
