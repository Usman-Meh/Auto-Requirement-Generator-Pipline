Program overview
Doctoral students in the Gastrointestinal Sciences program gain a deep understanding of normal digestive function, including the mechanisms responsible for dysfunction and the development of disease. Students work with highly-skilled scientists on research into illnesses such as inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis/Crohn’s Disease), irritable bowel disease, and bacterial (such as clostridium difficile) or parasitic (helminthes and giardiasis) infections. The wide range of program specializations reflects the diversity of research interests and disciplinary strengths of our faculty and students.
Students participate in journal clubs, research groups, interdisciplinary training and professional development activities.
