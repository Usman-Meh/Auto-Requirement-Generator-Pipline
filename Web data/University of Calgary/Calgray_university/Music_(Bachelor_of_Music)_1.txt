Why choose Music (Bachelor of Music)?
The Bachelor of Music (BMus) degree is designed for students wishing to enter a professional career in music, either as performers, teachers, composers, theorists, historians or critics. The BMus provides the opportunity for students to major in Performance, Composition, or Integrated Studies, as well as a combined Bachelor of Music/Bachelor of Education degree. All degrees include study in performance and composition with instruction in music history, theory, pedagogy and community involvement. You’ll graduate with artistic and theoretical training, creative thinking skills, research and analytical capabilities, as well as written and verbal communication skills.
Career opportunities
As a Bachelor of Music graduate, you'll be prepared for career opportunities in areas such as performance, education, composition, arts management, audio production and design, and more. Your degree can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies in music, or to another professional degree such as law, medicine or veterinary medicine.

Chair of the Music Performance area, Edmond also conducts the University of Calgary Orchestra, is a violin instructor and first violinist of the UCalgary String Quartet. “Because of the size of our program, students have an unusually great number of opportunities to perform and to experience a wide range of musical styles. Guest master classes, associations with the renowned ProMusica Chamber Music series, the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra, Mount Royal Conservatory, and access to the acoustically acclaimed Rozsa Centre create motivating and inspiring learning opportunities.
