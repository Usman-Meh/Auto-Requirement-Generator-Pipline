Program overview
​The graduate program in Immunology provides state-of-the-art training in immunological research. Students gain a foundation in the functions and interactions of all components of the immune system, including infections such as cryptococcus neoformans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, lyme disease and malaria, and diseases such as diabetes. Students participate in the Immunology Research Group (IRF). This group reflects the diversity and interdisciplinarity of the field, connecting students in the program with members from science and clinical departments throughout the Cumming School of Medicine and other University of Calgary departments. The IRG's core themes are development and physiology of cells of the immune system, and immunological mechanisms in disease and the inflammatory process.
