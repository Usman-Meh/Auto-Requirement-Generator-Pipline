Learn how to apply for admission
Why choose Bioinformatics?
Bioinformatics scholars ask questions such as: How different are people from one another? Can we effectively visualize enormous, complex sets of biological data? Can bioinformatics advance personalized medicine?
Bioinformatics focuses on the unique issues that occur when you apply computers to biological systems. During the course of your studies, you'll receive comprehensive training in computer science, mathematics, chemistry, physics and biology. Much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in class, during tutorials and in the laboratory.
Career opportunities
​With a degree in Bioinformatics, you’ll have global opportunities to work in pharmaceutical industries, biotechnology, genomics, genetics, business administration and more. This degree can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or architecture.
Program highlights
Collaborative team work - Interact with your peers while learning to collaborate on projects.
Lab work - Learn how to use tools and develop techniques within a supervised laboratory setting.
Study abroad opportunities - Cultural and academic experiences at destinations around the world.
Courses in this program
Developing Health Research Literacy I, Interdisciplinary Research Approaches, Introductory Calculus, Software Analysis And Design, ​Energy Flow in Biological Systems
