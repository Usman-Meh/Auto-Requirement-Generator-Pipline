Why choose Psychology (Bachelor of Arts)?
Psychologists ask questions such as: How do people behave and interact in groups in workplace settings? How does aging affect brain function? Why do people offer help to strangers?
Psychology is the scientific study of the biological, cognitive, emotional, and social bases of behaviour. There is a strong emphasis on written and verbal communication, as well as statistical analysis and research skills. Students who are interested in gaining experience with psychology research may pursue opportunities to work in research laboratories, either as a volunteer or as part of research courses. Psychology majors will gain a deeper understanding of the biological, cognitive, emotional, and social influences on the human experience. They will also gain experience in thinking critically and solving problems, conducting research and analyzing data, and communicating effectively as well as develop skills in information literacy, implementing ethical principles, and applying psychological knowledge and skills to personal, social, organizational, and societal problems.
You can earn both a Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Science in Psychology and a Bachelor of Community Rehabilitation in just five years through our combined degree program.
Career opportunities
​As a psychology graduate, you'll be prepared for career opportunities in areas such as the civil service, the non-profit sector, and the business world. A degree in psychology can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or education. Many of our graduated go on to pursue advanced graduate degrees to prepare them for careers as clinical psychologists, professors/academics, applied researchers or organizational consultants.
