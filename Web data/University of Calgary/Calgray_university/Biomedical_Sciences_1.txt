Learn how to apply for admission
Why choose Biomedical Sciences?
Biomedical Sciences scholars ask questions such as: Can you use viruses to kill cancer cells? How can you regenerate skin to treat burns? What can you learn about human diseases by studying fruit flies and zebrafish?
Biomedical Sciences involves ground breaking scientific research in areas such as cancer biology, neuroscience, gastrointestinal physiology, cardiovascular sciences, biochemistry, genetics and infectious diseases. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in class, during tutorials, in the laboratory and through summer research studentships.
Career opportunities
​With a degree in Biomedical Sciences, you’ll have global opportunities to work in pharmaceutical industries, biotechnology, genomics, genetics, business administration and more. This degree can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or architecture.
Courses in this program
Developing Health Research Literacy I, Interdisciplinary Research Approaches, Mechanics, University Calculus I, ​​Energy Flow in Biological Systems

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
I was a member of the first BHSc class. My instructors promoted every opportunity to get in the lab and get involved in research. They also supported my proposal to study/work abroad, which was key to bringing me to my current role as a scientist in neuroscience discovery at Roche in Switzerland. Here, I'm part of a massive team effort working to develop treatments for neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders; medicines I help create could one day make a huge difference to patients.
