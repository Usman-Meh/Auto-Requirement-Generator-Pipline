Thesis-based program
Start your application
Program overview
We offer an LLM (general) and an LLM with a specialization in Natural Resources, Energy and Environmental Law (NREEL).
We accept students who have demonstrated strong potential for advanced legal research and writing. Most students in our thesis-based LLM program come from common-law legal systems. You will work with a supervising faculty member to produce a substantial piece of original legal scholarship.
The Faculty of Law has a wide range of research expertise. We have long been leaders in natural resources, energy and environmental law. Other areas of particular research strength include business and tax law, private law, administrative law and regulation, criminal law, Indigenous people and law, international law, human rights law, legal history and theory, and the law pertaining to privacy, security and technology. The Faculty of Law is a home of the
Journal of Environmental Law and Practice
and for our acclaimed law blog, ABlawg (ablawg.ca).
Our LLM program was included in the LLM Guide's
top 10 energy law programs
worldwide (2019). Our program earns this recognition for strengths in examining the relationship between society and the environment, in defining the interests we claim in the world around us, and in shaping the consequences of using those resources. The faculty has endowed chairs in natural resources law, in business law, and in business regulation. Our substantial law library complemented by the internationally-renowned Canadian Institute of Resources Law, which hosts symposia and publishes research on natural resources and energy law.
Admission to this program is highly competitive: meeting the minimum requirements does not guarantee admission. This program is not usually especially helpful for students seeking to satisfy the
National Committee of Accreditation’s requirements for legal practice in Canada.
