Learn how to apply for admission
Why choose Nursing?
Nurses ask questions such as: How do people respond to illness? In what ways are lives impacted by sickness? How are patients cared for when they are unwell? Nurses working in rural communities apply their skills and knowledge across a variety of clinical settings to support the health and wellbeing of their community members, all while building strong relationships with their colleagues and patients.
In the rural community route, you'll get the opportunity to learn where you live through a blended course delivery model that includes clinical placements in your community. You will participate in engaging theory courses as well as hands-on labs that support your learning, so you can apply your skills right away.

Career opportunities
Registered nurses in rural communities support the health of their communities in a variety of settings including community agencies, home health care and acute hospital settings. Working in a rural setting often means that nurses work as part of a multi-disciplinary team across many areas of the health care system.
A degree in nursing can also be used as a stepping-stone to another professional degree or further studies at the graduate level.

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
I gained experience as a student leader, helping to build my confidence in conflict resolution, seeing the bigger picture and finding innovative solutions, important aspects of my nursing practice. I was taught to continue learning independently. Definitely one of the most important lessons I learned at UCalgary was to be excited to continue learning for the rest of my career.
