Why choose Nursing?
Nurses ask questions such as: How do people respond to illness? In what ways are lives impacted by sickness? How are patients cared for when they are unwell?
Leading the way on health-care teams, registered nurses are in high demand for their clinical skills and theoretical knowledge. Over the course of your studies, you'll be involved in active learning within the classroom, with small clinical groups in a variety of off-campus nursing practice settings, and in simulated clinical laboratories.

Career opportunities
​Registered nurses have global career opportunities in community agencies, hospital settings, childcare environments, the research sector, and more. A degree in nursing can also be used as a stepping-stone to another professional degree or further studies at the graduate level.

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
I gained experience as a student leader, helping to build my confidence in conflict resolution, seeing the bigger picture and finding innovative solutions, important aspects of my nursing practice. I was taught to continue learning independently. Definitely one of the most important lessons I learned at UCalgary was to be excited to continue learning for the rest of my career.
