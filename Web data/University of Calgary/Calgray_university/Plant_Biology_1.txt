Why choose Plant Biology?
Plant Biologists ask questions such as: How do harsh environmental conditions affect gene expression in crop plants? How and why do plants make important medicinal compounds? How have plants evolved to adapt to specific geographical regions?
Plant Biology is a challenging, dynamic, and broad branch of biology. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in class, during tutorials, and in the field or laboratory. As a Plant Biology major, you will have the opportunity to participate in a two-term independent research project in a plant biology laboratory supervised by faculty member where you will gain hands-on research experience.
Career opportunities
​Plant Biologists have global opportunities to work in areas such as plant biotechnology, agriculture, forestry, the pharmaceutical industry, and more. A degree in Plant Biology can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or a professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or architecture.
Program highlights

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
​I learned about the plant biology program soon after starting my studies at UCalgary. The professor who introduced me to the program was an excellent instructor, and truly passionate about this major. This inspired me to major in plant biology, and I haven’t looked back. Working towards my degree has been fun and interesting, and it’s taught by people who want me to succeed. There’s a laid back atmosphere among students and professors, and I’ve found the experience rewarding.
