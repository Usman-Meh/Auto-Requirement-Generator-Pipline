Why choose Film Studies?
Film Studies scholars ask questions such as: what is the interplay of truth and fiction in documentary cinema? How do film festivals shape critical, commercial, and creative practices? What can the work of Alfred Hitchcock teach us about contemporary global cinema? How exactly does the materiality of the filmstrip compare to new digital technologies?
For more than a century, motion pictures have flourished as the most pervasive medium for entertainment and expression, blending art with new technology in fascinating ways. Film Studies explores the kind of art form that film is today, as well as the ways the medium has both reflected and shaped global culture since its inception.
Career opportunities
​Film Studies courses provide relevant analytical skills as well as historical and theoretical frameworks to make sense of visual culture in the 21st century. As a graduate, you’ll be prepared for careers in film and media criticism; film programming and production; work in cultural institutions; and university research and teaching. A degree in Film Studies can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree.
Note: The Bachelor of Film Studies degree option is in partnership with the Southern Alberta Institute of
Technology (SAIT).

The film studies program has been a major help in directing me toward my passion, which is exhibition. I have been a volunteer with the Calgary International Film Festival since 2009, blogging and now previewing films. I review submissions and help advise the programming department. I also curated the short film selections for the 2012 Sled Island Film festival, and programmed the awards screenings. My goal is to work full-time for the programming department of a major film festival.
