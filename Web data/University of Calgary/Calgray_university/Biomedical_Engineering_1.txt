Why choose Biomedical Engineering?
Biomedical engineers work at the intersection of medicine, engineering, science and other disciplines to solve health challenges. Biomedical engineering is much more than applying engineering methods to living organisms. As a graduate, you will have the confidence and ability to communicate with different players in the life science fields, from clinicians and nurses to designers, scientists and other engineers. You will be able to see present needs and identify future solutions. Engineering solutions for health is one of the research priorities at the University of Calgary, with interdisciplinary research involving more than 300 faculty from the engineering school and non-traditional biomedical fields like nursing, veterinary medicine and kinesiology. There is a growing biomedical industry in Alberta and in Canada that needs graduates with skills that range from problem solving to teamwork and interpersonal communication.
The Biomedical Engineering program has a common first year, which consists of 10 courses in mathematics, sciences, computing, engineering principles, communications and design. A design backbone throughout the Biomedical Engineering program will form critical thinking and problem solving skills and provide opportunities to interact with local industry and researchers in many different fields of study. Most courses have hands-on, experiential laboratory sessions to reinforce concepts taught in lectures. Leadership skills development is fostered through open-ended projects and group work.
Career opportunities
As a biomedical engineer you will be able to use your skills to improve healthcare worldwide in the biotech, pharma and med-tech sectors — and beyond. A degree in biomedical engineering can also open doors for graduate studies or a professional degree such as medicine, veterinary medicine or law.
Program highlights
Collaborative team work - Interact with your peers while learning to collaborate on projects.
Engineering Career Centre – Access engineering career advisors and gain valuable full-time paid engineering work experience through a 12-16 month placement.
Study abroad opportunities - Cultural and academic experiences at destinations around the world.
