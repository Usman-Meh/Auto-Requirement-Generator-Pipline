Why choose Anthropology?
Social and Cultural Anthropologists ask questions such as: How does culture impact business transactions? Can society benefit from organized violence? Do all cultures experience disease the same way?
Anthropology is the comparative study of human society and culture. Anthropology recognizes the connections and diversities between cultures, societies and species to bring a holistic yet particularistic approach to contemporary global challenges. During the course of your studies, you'll gain statistical analysis skills, research capabilities, written and verbal communication skills, and a deeper understanding of cultures and world views that differ from your own.
Career opportunities
​As an Anthropology graduate, you’ll be prepared for career opportunities in areas such as the:
civil service
non-profit sector
business world
A degree in Anthropology can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or education.
Program highlights
Co-operative work placement - Gain valuable full-time paid work experience that alternates with your academic studies.

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
​Between his master’s and PhD studies in anthropology, Christopher was a professional poker player and gaming consultant. “My experiences give me a unique insight into the value of anthropology and allow me to connect with students. I'm a big believer in experiential learning. My goal is to have students think anthropologically, that means to see things holistically, understand other peoples' perspectives and think reflexively about the cultural influences on their own thinking and behaviour.
