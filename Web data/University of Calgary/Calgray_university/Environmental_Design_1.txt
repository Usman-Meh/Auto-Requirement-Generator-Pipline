Learn how to apply for admission
Why choose Environmental Design?
The Master in Environmental Design (MEDes) is an innovative thesis-based degree program offered by the Faculty of Environmental Design (EVDS). If you wish to expand your current professional or design-related background with advanced interdisciplinary practice-based research and study, then the MEDes program is for you. Blurring traditional disciplinary definitions, you'll undertake your studies in one or more areas included in EVDS, including the science of sustainable design and planning, digital design and fabrication, the history, pedagogy, process and practice of design and urban analysis and planning. Undergraduate study is required - you cannot enter the MEDes program directly from high school. The most up-to-date admission requirements can be found at evds.ucalgary.ca.
