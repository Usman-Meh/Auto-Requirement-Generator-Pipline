Why choose Social Work?
Social work is a profession that helps individuals, families, groups, and communities to improve their individual and collective well-being. Social workers work in a wide range of professional roles in many different areas including the health care system, private practice, the public sector, local and international community development and non-profit organizations.
During the course of your studies, you’ll gain research capabilities, practical experience, written and verbal communication skills, and a deeper understanding of how to help individuals and families within the context of their environment. As a social worker, you’ll be prepared for global career opportunities in settings such as hospitals, community health clinics, social service agencies, correctional facilities, consultation agencies, and the civil service. You may enter our program once you've completed either a social work diploma or two full years of university study, or as an after-degree student.
When I decided to go back to school, I wanted a career that aligned with my passion for working with people and seeking positive social change - social work was a natural fit. The best part of the experience was the people. As a cohort, we bonded in a way that brought a valued layer to learning. The program set me up for success and a promising career with the City of Lethbridge before I had even completed it.
