Why choose Environmental Science?
Environmental Science scholars ask questions such as: How can colony collapse disorder be prevented? Should genetically modified food be labeled as such? How does intensive farming impact plant biodiversity?
Environmental Science uses a multidisciplinary approach to understand the changes in our natural and human environment. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in the field, with supplementary learning in laboratories and classrooms. This program will provide you with key skills that include data collection and analysis, written and oral communication skills, and experience collaborating within teams.
Career opportunities
​Environmental Scientists have global opportunities to work in areas such as environmental assessments, industry consulting, the public sector, and more. A degree in Environmental Science can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or a professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or architecture.
Courses in this program
Energy Flow in Biological Systems, General Chemistry (Structure and Bonding), Introductory Calculus, ​Environmental Science Field Course I, ​Environmental Science Field Course II

The environmental sciences program taught me a diverse set of skills including research design, data analysis, and science communication. The coursework let me apply knowledge learned in lectures to many challenges that impact my community. As a result, I felt confident in my abilities to pursue careers that interested me. Perhaps the most meaningful part of my time as an environmental science student, though, was working with and learning from my talented and passionate peers and professors.
