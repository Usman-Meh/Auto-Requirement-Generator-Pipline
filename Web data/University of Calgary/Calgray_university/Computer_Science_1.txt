Why choose Computer Science?
Computer Science scholars ask questions such as: Can we build computers that think like humans? How can we improve computer games that feature evolving characters? What is the future of augmented reality?
Computer science is a field of theoretical and practical problem solving, combining creativity with mathematics, logic and communication. A strong understanding of computer science principles helps prepare you for a long career of problem solving and system building without requiring continual training.
During the course of your studies, you will actively be solving problems and building new programs in class and tutorial labs. Students interested in gaining experience with computer science research may pursue opportunities to work in research laboratories, either as a volunteer or as part of research courses.
Career opportunities
​As a computer science graduate, you'll be prepared for career opportunities in areas such as the civil service, the non-profit sector, and the business world. A degree in computer science can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or education.
