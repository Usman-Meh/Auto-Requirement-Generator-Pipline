Thesis-based program
Start your application
Program overview
Ambitious students can explore their interest and aptitude in performing research by taking the Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering (MSc Thesis) degree. As a stepping stone to the PhD degree, the program allows students to investigate a new research topic in depth with a leading researcher in the mechanical engineering program. Through things such as conferences, peer-reviewed publications and technical papers, students get to disseminate knowledge. They will complete technical courses, present at a conference, and prepare and defend a thesis documenting their research over the course of their two years of full-time study. Students are typically funded through the duration of their study under various mechanisms offered by the faculty, department, and supervisor.
