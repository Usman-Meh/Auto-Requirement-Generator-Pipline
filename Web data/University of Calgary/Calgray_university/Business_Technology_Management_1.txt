Learn how to apply for admission
Why choose Business Technology Management?
Business technology management scholars ask questions such as: How can technology improve a process? What maintenance will a product require? Who should be on the project team?
Business technology managers examine the use, management, and impact of information technologies on individuals, organizations, industries, the economy and society. You'll combine industry knowledge, practical applications, and academic principles to examine new technologies and understand their impact on the business environment. You'll complete formal presentations, group projects and various case studies during your degree.
Career opportunities
As a graduate of the Bachelor of Commerce degree with a concentration in business technology management, you'll be prepared for global career opportunities in the areas of marketing, finance, accounting, human resources, and more. A degree in commerce can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or education.

Degree concentrations (additional information)
The information systems concentration at the Haskayne School of Business offers students a unique opportunity to study a blend of traditional management practice and theory with technical information systems topics, such as database management and systems design. I transferred to Haskayne from computer science, as it expanded my scope of study to include bigger organizational implications. My favourite part of the program was having the opportunity to work with a local non-profit organization to redesign its internal systems.
