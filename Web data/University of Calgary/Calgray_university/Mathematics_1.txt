Why choose Mathematics?
The Mathematics major explores the various branches of mathematics and statistics and their applications in the real world. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in class, during tutorials and in take-home written assignments. You’ll learn mathematical and statistical fundamentals and gain exposure to a variety of modern subdisciplines of these subjects including abstract algebra, analysis, biostatistics, differential equations, geometry, logic, number theory, machine learning, probability and stochastic processes.
Career opportunities
As a mathematician or statistician, you’ll have global opportunities to work in areas such as quantitative finance, industrial mathematics, computing and software development, data science and analytics, primary and secondary school teaching, public policy statistics, and postgraduate academic research. The creative, exploratory and lateral thinking in problem solving you’ll develop in this degree will be applicable to a wide variety of career opportunities.
A degree in Mathematics can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies in mathematics and statistics or in related disciplines like engineering, physics, computer science. The Mathematics program also serves as a gateway to a postgraduate professional degree such as education, law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or architecture.
