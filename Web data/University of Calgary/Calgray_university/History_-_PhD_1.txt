Program overview
Learn from internationally recognized scholars in a program with excellent student-to-supervisor ratios. Departmental expertise is wide-ranging; our historians are specialists in histories of Africa, Canada, China, Europe, Latin America and the United States. Students learn valuable skills in argumentative writing, critical thinking, public speaking, and grant proposal writing. Typically, students base their doctoral research in archival work within Canada and abroad. Students will complete a dissertation that contributes meaningfully to their chosen fields as they gain experience in teaching at an undergraduate level, present at conferences, and prepare research for publication.
