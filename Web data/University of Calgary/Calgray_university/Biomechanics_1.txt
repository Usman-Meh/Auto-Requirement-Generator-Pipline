Why choose Biomechanics?
Biomechanics scholars ask questions such as: Can the correct skate improve your stride? Why is the Fosbury Flop such an effective high jumping technique? How do ski boots impact knee injuries?
Biomechanics examines the forces acting upon and within a biological structure, as well as the effects produced by these forces. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in class and during labs. You'll learn how to apply mechanical theories and concepts to living systems with special emphasis on the human body and its movement, structure, and function.
Career opportunities
​Biomechanics graduates have global opportunities to work in areas such as coaching, recreation, health and fitness, research, and more. A degree in Biomechanics can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or architecture.
Program highlights
Lab work - Learn how to use tools and develop techniques within a supervised laboratory setting.
Practicum experience - Opportunity to gain hands-on career related experiences in a professional setting.
Study abroad opportunities - Cultural and academic experiences at destinations around the world.
