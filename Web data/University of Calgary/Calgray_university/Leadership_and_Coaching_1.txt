Why choose Leadership and Coaching?
Leadership and Coaching scholars ask questions such as: What are the benefits of physical activity on the body and mind? How can people be motivated to incorporate activity into their personal lifestyle?
Leadership and coaching examines the foundations for leadership in physical activity in a variety of settings such as recreation and coaching. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will include concepts to help others learn physical skills and activities that can be used in leisure and recreation, fitness and rehabilitation, competitive sports, and elite personal challenges.
Career opportunities
Leadership and Coaching graduates have global opportunities to work in areas such as sport medicine and rehabilitation, recreation, health and fitness, research and more. A degree in Leadership and Coaching can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or architecture.
