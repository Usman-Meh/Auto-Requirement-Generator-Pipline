Learn how to apply for admission
Why choose Undeclared (Arts)?
This option gives you the flexibility to explore different courses; you do not have a specific major. You can take a full course load and register in any Faculty of Arts course that does not indicate a specific major as a prerequisite. From October 1 to February 1 of your first year, you can request a change of program (COP) through your Student Centre. Your first-year grades will be considered for the COP if you have completed a minimum of 12 units. We encourage you to speak with your Faculty advisor in your first year to help with course planning.
