Why choose Electrical Engineering?
Electrical engineers ask questions such as: How can computers perform faster calculations? Can we get more energy from the current power system? How do cellular phones work?
Electrical engineers are involved in almost every facet of our high-tech world. They explore and develop new and innovative technologies through the research and manipulation of electrical phenomena. Electrical engineering reaches every corner of our lives, which means the techniques and skills you’ll gain will be directly applicable to a wide range of real world work environments. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur in class, during tutorials, and through working on an advanced-level project in specialized research-and-design courses.
This fully accredited program features a common first year, which consists of 10 courses in mathematics, sciences, computing, engineering principles, communications and design. These courses will provide you with a solid foundation for your engineering training and introduce you to a variety of engineering disciplines. You'll apply for admission to a specific engineering program at the end of your first year.
Career opportunities
As an electrical engineer, you’ll have global opportunities to work in areas such as communications, scientific research, aerospace technology, and more. A degree in engineering can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or a professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or architecture.​
Program highlights
Collaborative team work - Interact with your peers while learning to collaborate on projects.
Engineering Career Centre – Access engineering career advisors and gain valuable full-time paid work experience through a 12-16 month placement.
Study abroad opportunities - Cultural and academic experiences at destinations around the world.

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
The electrical engineering program taught me the technical resources that I needed to have success in the companies that I’ve worked for, whether it be a telecommunications company, whether it be an oil and gas company, whether it be the consulting company that I currently work for. More-so (it taught me) the ability to learn, the ability to adapt in any environment, in any company​.
