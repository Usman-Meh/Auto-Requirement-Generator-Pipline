Why choose History?
History is the study of the human past as it is constructed and interpreted with human artifacts, written evidence, and oral traditions. It requires empathy for historical actors, respect for interpretive debate, and the skillful use of an evolving set of practices and tools.
History is about change and continuity over time and space. Historians gain an understanding of complex cause-and-effect relationships by gathering, organizing and evaluating historical sources from a variety of perspectives. During the course of your studies, you'll gain research capabilities, develop your oral and verbal communication, logical and abstract reasoning skills, and the capacity to think in historical terms.
Career opportunities
​As a history graduate, you'll be prepared for career opportunities in areas such as the non-profit sector, the private sector and the business world. A degree in history can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, business, journalism, government service, or education.
