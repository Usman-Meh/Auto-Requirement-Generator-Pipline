Why choose Exercise and Health Physiology?
Exercise and Health Physiology scholars ask questions such as: How do athletes attain optimal performance? Can exercise help to prevent chronic disease? How does regular physical activity assist in maintaining a healthy body composition?
Exercise and Health Physiology builds on the knowledge of human movement and function to focus on the impacts that lifestyle, exercise and diet have on the human body. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in class and during labs. You’ll develop an understanding of the complex functioning of the human body at the molecular, cellular and systemic levels and learn to apply your knowledge in real world situations.
Career opportunities
Exercise and Health Physiologists have global opportunities to work in areas such as sport medicine and rehabilitation, recreation, health and fitness, research and more. A degree in Exercise and Health Physiology can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or architecture.​

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
I think it was my fascination for the human body that attracted me most to kinesiology. I love learning how our bodies function as well as the things that can occur in terms of illness and disease that can inhibit proper function. I love that no matter where I end up in life I know that I will be able to utilize the knowledge I have gained from the undertaking of this program.
