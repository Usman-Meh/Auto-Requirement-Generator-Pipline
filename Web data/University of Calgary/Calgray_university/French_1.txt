Why choose French?
French scholars ask questions such as: How did Claude Monet influence the art world? What is the legacy of the French Revolution? How did the Romance languages develop?
Studying French will provide you with a multidisciplinary examination of French language, literature, culture, art and history. This program will allow you to improve your French communication skills while also discovering the Francophone world in all its variety. During the course of your studies, you'll gain creative thinking skills, research and analytical capabilities, intercultural awareness, and the ability to fluently communicate in French.
Career opportunities
​As a graduate of the French program you'll be prepared for career opportunities in areas such as the civil service, the non-profit sector, and the business world. A degree in French can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or education.
Program highlights
Co-operative work placement - Gain valuable full-time paid work experience that alternates with your academic studies.
Honours Degree - In-depth study of a specific topic completed under the supervision of a faculty member.

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
As a boy growing up in Eastern Ontario, I loved going on family trips to Montreal where I could hear people speaking French. Since then, I have lived and studied in France and French has become the language of my heart.” Anthony brings a rich cultural and intellectual perspective to his teaching. He is particularly interested in French art and uses it in class as an introduction to French culture. In addition to UCalgary, he has taught university courses in Germany, France and Brazil.
