Learn how to apply for admission
Why choose Finance?
Finance scholars ask questions such as: What causes interest rates to rise? How is the weighted average cost of capital calculated? What is the best way to value a business?
Financial managers make decisions about pursuing uncertain investment opportunities and deciding how to finance these investments. Over the course of your studies you'll develop your skills using spreadsheet and statistical software, as well as learn how to adapt basic financial principles to the changing business environment. You'll complete live projects, formal presentations, group projects and various case studies during your degree.
Career opportunities
As a graduate of the Bachelor of Commerce degree with a concentration in finance, you'll be prepared for global career opportunities in the areas of banking, securities, international finance, and more. A degree in commerce can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or education.

Degree concentrations (additional information)
Since I graduated with a degree in finance, my career has taken me into public policy. Policy-makers often get caught up in political aspects and forget the financial and economic impacts of legislation. The skills and theory I learned during my undergraduate degree have allowed me to avoid this trap and bring a fresh perspective. While completing my master’s thesis in public policy, I integrated theory I learned in my finance courses to develop a financial-based analysis of the effects of government intervention on oil sands investment. That would have been impossible without the skills I learned.
