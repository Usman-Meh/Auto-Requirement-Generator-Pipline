Why choose Energy Science?
Energy-intensive applications like AI and electric vehicles grow global energy needs each year. That means energy science is more important than ever to help ensure a sustainable energy future for everyone. The Energy Science program uses a cross-disciplinary approach to study energy generation, transmission, and storage. In addition to learning about all sources of energy – conventional, renewables and beyond – you’ll also develop a strong background in energy policy, regulation and communications. When you graduate, you’ll be ready to make a difference in a high-impact energy career or pursue further research in this important field.
Career opportunities
Energy Science opens up a wide range of careers in the conventional, renewable, and emerging energy fields. Here are some of the many sectors you might work in with a background in Energy Science:
Energy generation, transmission, and storage
Energy research and innovation
Science communications
Policy and administration
Legal and regulatory
Nonprofits in the energy and environmental fields
Key components of the program
Foundational concepts in physics and chemistry.
Exposure to a wide range of energy sources and their applications.
Strong blend of science with energy policy, history, and regulation.
Capstone project focused on relevant energy issues, including chances to work with industry partners on real-world problems.
Courses in this program
Deep dives into hydroelectric, geothermal, solar, wind, bio and nuclear energy, supplemented by broad courses focused on introducing energy science, energy transformations, climate change, the history of energy, and energy policy
Every aspect of quality of life is deeply tied to how we access energy in various forms. These needs must be balanced against increasing environmental concerns about the consequences of our energy sources. This program will train students to understand these dynamics and help build a sustainable energy future for everyone.
