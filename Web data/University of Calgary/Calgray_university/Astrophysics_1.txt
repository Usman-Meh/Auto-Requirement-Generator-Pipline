Astrophysics
Bachelor of Science (BSc)
Learn how to apply for admission
Why choose Astrophysics?
Astrophysics scholars ask questions such as: How can the properties of dark matter and energy be determined? Do wormholes exist? How do galaxies form?
Astrophysics is the application of physics to the study of astronomical objects and phenomena. The goal of Astrophysics is to understand and explain how astronomical objects and phenomena occur and work. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in class, during tutorials, in the laboratory, and the nearby Rothney Astrophysical Observatory. This degree will provide you with practice conducting experiments and observations, computational and logic skills, and strong problem-solving abilities.
Career opportunities
Astrophysicists have global opportunities to work in areas such as medical physics, geophysics, nuclear energy, and more. A degree in Astrophysics can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as architecture, engineering, law, and medicine.
Courses in this program
Classical Physics, Modern Physics, Calculus for Engineers and Scientists, Linear Methods I, Introduction to Computer Science, General Chemistry: Structure and Bonding

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
Our faculty owns and operates a large observatory that puts research grade telescopes and detectors into the hands of budding scientists. The Rothney Astrophysical Observatory is the largest of its kind in Canada, and incorporating it into teaching makes our undergraduate astrophysics program the top in the country. Last semester, students measured the physical size of an asteroid and planetary nebula, measured the distance to a quasar, and figured out the elements in the atmosphere of a star.
