Biomedical Engineering
Master of Engineering (MEng)
Course-based program
Start your application
Program overview
The Master of Engineering in Biomedical Engineering (course-based) will provide advanced, specialized, and industry-relevant engineering knowledge to baccalaureate-prepared engineers and those with other technical degrees (science, kinesiology, etc.) looking to gain new skills to support a transition into a new direct practice area. The program will help to fill a gap in available programs to train engineers in advanced technical skills and in-demand areas in engineering for the bio and health economies.
For professional engineers, the program will strengthen knowledge and skills that are specific to their areas of practice and will remove barriers to the development of advanced technical skills, education, and professional development skills. For non-engineers, the program will provide a solid foundation in health technology and technology development.
Students can enter the program with a variety of backgrounds, including Engineering, Medicine, Physical Sciences, Kinesiology, Health or Life Sciences. The program was developed considering the specific needs of professionals in the medtech / healthtech industries. Medtech are technologies primarily used inside health care settings by professionals to diagnose and treat conditions (e.g., medical imaging, surgical tools). On the other hand, Healthtech refers to technologies designed to be used outside of hospitals and health care settings so individuals can monitor their health (e.g., wearables); these technologies have more applications on the prevention side.
The role and scope of technology involved in health, from point-of-care diagnostics, to sport performance, to imaging, wearables and more, means that individuals with many traditional engineering backgrounds have increasing needs for health-specific technical knowledge as well as medtech / healthtech field knowledge. Given the rising costs of healthcare and the strain put on the system by the COVID-19 pandemic, we anticipate a growing demand for individuals in these industries.
MEng Internship
This program offers an 8-to-16 month full-time paid internship with companies across Canada to help students gain engineering work experience in a diverse economy. Limited spots are available.

MEng Internship Page.
Completing this program
The Master of Engineering in Biomedical Engineering is a 30-unit graduate level program. Students would normally take 6 core courses and 4 elective courses. In addition to these elective options, students will also be able to choose from a list of additional courses if they wish to obtain more specialized training within an area of biomedical engineering; these additional courses are grouped into four themes - Human Mobility, Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Regenerative Medicine and Health Monitoring and Management.
Outcomes
Biomedical Engineering is a relatively new discipline that combines engineering tools, techniques and problem-solving with biological, health and medical knowledge to advance knowledge and solve problems in animal and human biology, medicine and health care. Graduates work in a variety of fields or industries including: medical imaging, biomedical sensors, instrumentation, cell and tissue engineering, orthopedics, cell therapy, biomaterials, clinical engineering, rehabilitation, sports performance, telehealth, biomechanics, immunoengineering, diagnostic devices, and many others. Graduates of the Master of Engineering in Biomedical Engineering (course-based) will be ready to enter the workforce in these industries.
A course-based master’s degree in biomedical engineering is usually considered a final degree.
