Why choose Energy Engineering?
Energy engineers ask questions such as: How do ground conditions impact the installation of wind turbines? Can extraction processes be redesigned to minimize environmental damage? How can our existing power systems be enhanced by renewable energy production?
Energy Engineers find new, efficient, and sustainable ways to supply the world with energy. Our Energy Engineering program addresses the energy industry’s need for engineering graduates who bring a unique mix of technology and engineering science skills and knowledge to the workplace, which sets them apart from graduates of traditional engineering programs. This fully accredited transfer program allows you to combine an energy-related engineering technology diploma from an approved polytechnic institute with an engineering degree from the University of Calgary’s Schulich School of Engineering within as little as 24 months of study.
Career opportunities
As an Energy Engineer, you’ll have global opportunities to work across the full energy life cycle in extraction, production, conversion, refining, transmission, distribution and reclamation, including alternative energy. A degree in engineering can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or a professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or architecture.
Program highlights
Collaborative team work - Interact with your peers while learning to collaborate on projects.
Engineering Career Centre – Access engineering career advisors and gain valuable full-time paid work experience through a 12-16 month placement.
Study abroad opportunities - Cultural and academic experiences at destinations around the world.
