Learn how to apply for admission
Why choose Chemical Engineering?
Chemical engineers ask questions such as: How is crude oil refined into marketable products? Can industrial processes be redesigned to reduce pollution? How can we ensure safe chemical plant operations?
Chemical engineers convert raw materials into valuable products, or separate complex mixtures into their constituent components. Chemical engineering is one of the most broadly-based engineering disciplines, which means the techniques and skills you’ll gain will be directly applicable to a wide range of real world work environments. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur in class, during tutorials, and through designing a complete industrial process for a specific product.
This fully accredited program features a common first year, which consists of 10 courses in mathematics, sciences, computing, engineering principles, communications and design. These courses will provide you with a solid foundation for your engineering training and introduce you to a variety of engineering disciplines. You'll apply for admission to a specific engineering program at the end of your first year.
Career opportunities
​Chemical engineers enjoy stable career prospects because the items they manufacture are in constant demand. You’ll have global opportunities to work in areas such as biomedicine, scientific research, biotechnology, and more. A degree in engineering can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or a professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or architecture.
Program highlights
Collaborative team work - Interact with your peers while learning to collaborate on projects.
Engineering Career Centre – Access engineering career advisors and gain valuable full-time paid engineering work experience through a 12-16 month placement.
Study abroad opportunities - Cultural and academic experiences at destinations around the world.

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
​I respected our professors who had industry experience as it brought a lot of meaning to our studies by tying them back to reality. It wasn't until 20 years later that I started to appreciate how much work those early professors had done to set up a new engineering school. The Schulich School of Engineering is now providing an even higher level of experiential learning. A good engineering education is a huge life asset!
