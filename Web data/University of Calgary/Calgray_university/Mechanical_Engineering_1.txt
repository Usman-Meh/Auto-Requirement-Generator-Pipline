Why choose Mechanical Engineering?
Mechanical engineers ask questions such as: How can you determine the mechanical strength of a titanium alloy? Can wind turbines be redesigned to improve efficiency? Are passive pipeline leak-detection systems reliable?
Mechanical engineers research, design, test, develop and manufacture various mechanical devices. The work of mechanical engineers surrounds us in our everyday lives, which means the techniques and skills you’ll gain will be directly applicable to a wide range of professional environments.
The Mechanical Engineering program begins after completion of a common first year, which consists of 10 courses in mathematics, sciences, computing, engineering principles, communications and design. The program features a wide range of courses on the mathematics, science, design and operation of mechanical systems. Most courses have hands-on laboratories that demonstrate concepts learned in class. The program features problem-based learning, group work and opportunities for industry interaction and entrepreneurship through open-ended design projects.
Students in mechanical engineering have the option to complete a minor in aerospace engineering, mechatronics engineering, manufacturing engineering, biomedical engineering, digital engineering, energy and environment, entrepreneurship and enterprise development, management and society, or petroleum engineering.
Career opportunities
Mechanical engineers enjoy stable career prospects because the products they design and manufacture are in constant demand. Since mechanical engineering is one of the broadest engineering disciplines, you’ll have global opportunities to work in areas such as energy, automation, aerospace, manufacturing, transportation and more. A degree in mechanical engineering also opens doors to graduate studies or a second professional degree such as law, medicine, architecture or business administration.
Program highlights
Collaborative teamwork – Interact with your peers while learning to collaborate on projects.
Engineering Career Centre – Access engineering career advisors and gain valuable full-time paid work experience through a 12 to 16-month placement.
Study-abroad opportunities – Cultural and academic experiences at destinations around the world.
Courses in this program
Course themes in the program include computer-aided design, dynamics, solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, materials, machine dynamics, aerodynamics, mechatronics, control systems, robotics and design.

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
Mechanical engineering really appeals to those people who like hands-on work and who like to see tangible results. We get to take some courses that were really interesting because they were a bit of all sorts of engineering disciplines. The good thing about mechanical engineering is it’s so versatile. It applies to so many different industries.​
