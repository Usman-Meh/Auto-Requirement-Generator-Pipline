Bachelor of Science (BSc)
Learn how to apply for admission
Why choose Geophysics?
Geophysics is the application of the laws and techniques of physics to uncover knowledge about the earth’s dynamic processes and subsurface structure. Geophysicists ask questions such as: How do earthquakes and tsunamis form and can they be predicted? What are the properties of the Earth's gravitational and magnetic fields? How can seismic waves be used to study the Earth's interior and find natural resources?
During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in class, during tutorials, and in the laboratory. This degree will provide you with a foundation in geology, geophysics, physics, and mathematics, to apply data acquisition methods and interpretation to geophysical exploration, global earth studies, and the study of relevant rock properties.
Career opportunities
Geologists have global career opportunities in resource industries (oil & gas and other energy resources, metals and other natural materials), engineering/environmental assessment firms, state geological surveys, research institutions, and more. A degree in geology can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as business, law, or education.​

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
​When I arrived at UCalgary as a new geophysics instructor in 2015, I was excited to see the strong support for experiential learning at this institution. In particular, the geophysics field school, which gives senior undergraduate geophysics students hands on experience with data collection and analysis, was visited by several members of the senior executive staff in the Faculty of Science. This clearly demonstrates the importance that is placed on connecting theory with practice at UCalgary.
