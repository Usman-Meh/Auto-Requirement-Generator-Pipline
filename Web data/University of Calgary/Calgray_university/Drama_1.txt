Why choose Drama?
Drama practitioners and scholars explore questions such as: How does the theatre reflect and influence contemporary culture?  How can dramaturgy enhance a production? Did William Shakespeare write all the plays that bear his name? What stories are told, by whom and why? What other stories need to be told?
Drama and theatre provide the means not only to reconstruct the world as it is, but also to model human possibilities. In this program you'll enhance your understanding of drama by participating in productions, interacting with professionals, and acquiring practical and theoretical foundations that will help you build a solid career. During the course of your studies you'll gain creative thinking skills, research and analytical capabilities, written and verbal communication skills, as well as rigorous practical and theoretical training in drama.
Career opportunities
As a Drama graduate, you'll be prepared for career opportunities in areas such as Artistic Direction of a  theatre company, Set or Costume Designer for theatre or television series, or Arts Consultant in a the business or not-for-profit sector. An Arts degree can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as education, law, medicine, architectural design or digital game design.

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
The study of drama is older than almost every field of study and yet it continually adapts to the new technologies, ideas and practices. UCalgary is the place to be. It is old enough to be wise and young enough to be nimble. In my section, we are working on a brand new unit that blends the best of traditional scholarship with the best of artistic practice. It is an exciting time to be here and students should join us for the adventure.
