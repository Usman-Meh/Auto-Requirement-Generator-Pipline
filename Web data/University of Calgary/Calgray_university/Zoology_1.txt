Why choose Zoology?
Zoologists ask questions such as: Do chemicals that we release into rivers affect fish populations? What changes occur in brain cells with aging, and can we reverse these changes? What can fossils tell us about how changes in the environment will affect animals?
Zoology is the scientific study of animal biology from the perspective of the entire organism. As a highly interdisciplinary discipline, zoologists develop a broad knowledge base to inform their understanding of the animals with which we share our planet. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur in class, during tutorials, and in the field or laboratory. You may also gain hands-on experience in field studies in Canada or abroad.
Career opportunities
​Zoologists have global career opportunities in areas such as environmental management and conservation, scientific research, biotechnology, and more. A degree in zoology can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or education.
