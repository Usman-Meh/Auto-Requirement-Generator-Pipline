Why choose Gender and Sexuality Studies?
University of Calgary’s Gender and Sexuality Studies (GSXS) program focuses on issues of gender and sexuality, as well as race, class, disability, citizenship/documentation, age, and environmental issues.

GSXS instructors are committed to collaborative and participatory classrooms, decolonial learning, and a human rights agenda.
