Program overview
Students with a bachelor’s degree who are looking enjoy a wide variety of research that is at the forefront of many fields should consider getting a Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (MSc Thesis) degree. Research can include everything from biochemistry to molecular research, as well as cellular and developmental biology. It also ranges from genetics and immunology to bioinformatics, with applications to cancer and clinical research. As they deepen their skills, students will get to enjoy the amenities of a large city near the outdoor leisure activities of the Rocky Mountains. Completion of the program usually takes two years of full-time study.
