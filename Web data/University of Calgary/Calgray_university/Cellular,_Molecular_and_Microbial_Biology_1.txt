Why choose Cellular, Molecular and Microbial Biology?
Cellular, Molecular and Microbial Biologists ask questions such as: How do cells of bacteria, plants and animals function? How do cellular processes influence our lives? Can the genes from one organism be transferred into another to prevent or treat diseases?
Cellular, Molecular and Microbial Biology (CMBI) is the study of how single-celled organisms and cells function at a molecular level. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in class, during tutorials and in the laboratory.
As a student in CMBI, you’ll get a broad perspective on diverse topics including the function of molecules in cells, the relationships between cell structure and cell function, the importance of microbes to the environment, industry and disease and the interactions of microbes with each other and with plant and animal cells.
Career opportunities
Cellular, Molecular and Microbial Biologists have global opportunities to work in areas such as biotechnology, medical research, toxicology, and more. A degree in Cellular, Molecular and Microbial Biology can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or architecture.​
