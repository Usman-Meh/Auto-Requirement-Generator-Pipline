Program overview
A global leader in research, the department of Physics and Astronomy offers exciting, diverse and competitive graduate programs. The thesis-based MSc in Physics and Astronomy appeals to students planning an academic career or wishing to gain research experience in physics, astronomy or radiation oncology. The program connects students with state-of-the-art experimental and computational facilities both here and at collaborating institutions, and with world-renowned researchers in one of six focus areas: Astronomy and Astrophysics, Complexity, Environmental and Isotope Physics, Radiation Oncology Physics, Quantum Information and Quantum, Atomic, and Molecular Optics, and Space Physics. These focus areas lie within program specializations that students apply to: Physics, Astrophysics, Space Physics or Radiation Oncology Physics (including Medical Imaging/Medical Physics).
The MSc in Radiation Oncology Physics is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Physics Education Programs (CAMPEP) and provides didactic background, research experience and clinical training for a career in Radiation Oncology Physics.  Most academic centres and Canadian radiation oncology clinics require a PhD.  However, many clinical physicists in the United States and elsewhere have a terminal MSc degree.
The department's per capita funding level is the highest within UCalgary's Faculty of Science. Admission is competitive, favouring students who demonstrate academic excellence and leadership.
