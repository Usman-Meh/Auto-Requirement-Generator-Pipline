Why choose Global Development Studies?
Global Development Studies scholars ask questions such as: How do we define human rights? What does it mean for a country to ‘develop’? How is the global community interconnected?
Global Development Studies is a multidisciplinary field that examines social, economic, and political change. This program will give you a broad understanding of societal problems through analyzing the economic, political, cultural, and geographic factors that impact development issues. During the course of your studies, you'll gain cultural understanding, practical experiences, analytic skills, and research capabilities.
Career opportunities
​As a Global Development Studies graduate, you'll be prepared for career opportunities in areas such as civil service, the non-profit sector, and the business world. A degree in Global Development Studies can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or education.

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
I did a semester in Spain and field studies in Central Europe and SE Asia, experiences that gave me a first-hand look at global issues around water, food scarcity, community structure and sustainable economic development.
