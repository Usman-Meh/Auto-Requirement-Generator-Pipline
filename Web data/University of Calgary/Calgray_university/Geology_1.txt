Why choose Geology?
Geologists study the history, composition, and physical aspects of our planet and ask questions such as: What are the processes (physical, chemical, biological) that occur in the various layers of the earth? How and when did the Rocky Mountains form? Where can we find useful resources such as water, hydrocarbons, and metals?
The entire world will be your laboratory, as geology is the most outdoor-oriented scientific discipline. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur in class, during tutorials and in laboratories. You may also gain hands-on experience conducting research at field schools in both Canada and the United States.
Career opportunities
​Geologists have global career opportunities in resource industries (oil and gas and other energy resources, metals and other natural materials), engineering/environmental assessment firms, state geological surveys, research institutions, and more. A degree in geology can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degrees such as business, law, or education.

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
​The geology department at UCalgary has provided me with a lot of interesting hands-on experience. I had the opportunity to participate in field schools, where I was able to map the regional geology of various areas. I attended field school in different areas of Alberta, British Columbia, and Montana, and it was a very fun experience. This type of knowledge cannot be taught in the classroom, and is an important skill to have when pursuing a career in geology.
