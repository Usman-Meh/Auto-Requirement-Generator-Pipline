Program overview
This eight-month post-doctoral program is designed to provide the didactic background and clinical training necessary for PhD physicists to be eligible for admission to a residency in clinical radiation oncology physics. It is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Physics Education Programs, or CAMPEP. Admission to the program does not imply admission to the residency program.
Students will acquire a broad background in medical physics, including, radiation physics, radiobiology, radiation safety, medical imaging and the modern practice of radiation oncology, through intensive coursework and hands-on experience. Our courses are taught by qualified, practising clinical physicists.
