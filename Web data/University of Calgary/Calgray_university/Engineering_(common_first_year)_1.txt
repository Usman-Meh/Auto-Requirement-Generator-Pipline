Why choose engineering at UCalgary?
We start your engineering education off right, with a common core of first-year courses. This opportunity to explore a wide range of engineering disciplines, and hone your foundational skills, sets you up for success when you choose your major in second-year.
The common first-year includes 10 courses in engineering design, mathematics, science and engineering principles to prepare you for your remaining three years in a specific engineering major.
Attend classes in pre-scheduled blocks
We keep things simple for you, scheduling you in an “engineering block.” You go through your first year with the same group of students – a great way to build relationships, create study groups and get to know your peers.
Guaranteed placement in your major
Following the successful completion of your full first year, you will choose an engineering major. We guarantee placement in your first choice of program. This is where you select the type of BSc (Eng) you wish to complete: Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Engineering Physics, Geomatics Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Software Engineering, Sustainable Systems Engineering.
