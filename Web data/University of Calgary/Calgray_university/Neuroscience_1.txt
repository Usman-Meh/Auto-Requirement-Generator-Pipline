Why choose Neuroscience?
Neuroscience scholars ask questions such as: Why do we experience emotions? What role do odours play in mothers bonding with their offspring? How are memories stored and retrieved?
Neuroscience is a rapidly expanding branch of the life sciences that examines brain and behaviour. This degree will provide you with a broad understanding of the molecular and cellular foundations of the behavioural processes that allow animals and humans to respond to the challenges encountered in daily life. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in class, during tutorials, and in the laboratory.
Career opportunities
​​Neuroscientists have global opportunities to work in areas such as biotechnology, biomedical research, pharmaceuticals, public health services, and more. A degree in Neuroscience can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as medicine or veterinary medicine.
