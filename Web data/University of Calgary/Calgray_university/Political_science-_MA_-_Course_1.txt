The Department of Political Science at the University of Calgary is among the strongest in Canada. Our scholars are pivotal in shaping political discourse in Canada and around the world, through their research and publishing in major scholarly journals, through training graduate students to become leaders in academic, public and private sector careers, and through their active participation in public debates about politics in Canada and international affairs.
Our program covers the traditional fields of political science and offers unparalleled strengths in the areas of Canadian politics, elections and voting behaviour, international law, political violence, history of political thought, gender and politics, and indigenous politics.
