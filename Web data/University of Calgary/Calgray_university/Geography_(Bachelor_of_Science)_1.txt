Why choose Geography (Bachelor of Science)?
Geography scholars ask questions such as: Who participates in Mexico City’s informal economy? How do logging operations impact aquatic ecosystems? Does urban sprawl increase homelessness?
Geography is an integrative discipline that explores the earth as a whole system. Geographers focus on places and spaces to understand the interrelated elements associated with environmental, economic, political, and cultural change, and to propose solutions to problems in these areas. During the course of your studies, you will develop skills in research, geospatial methods, logical and abstract reasoning, as well as in-depth knowledge of the different regions and cultures that make up our global community.
Career opportunities
​As a geography graduate, you will be prepared for career opportunities in public service, the non-profit sector, or the business world. A degree in geography can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as architecture, law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or education.

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
With expertise and experience in satellite imagery, museum outreach, parks interpretation and running a farm, Professor Myrka Hall-Beyer notices things. “Geography teaches how to pay attention to things and to be open to stuff you might not have noticed before. My aim is to prepare students to deal effectively and ethically with anything a geographer might meet; to learn how where matters - from the shape of the land surface, to health services planning, and everything in between.
