Learn how to apply for admission
Why choose Biological Sciences?
Biologists ask questions such as: How does an ecosystem remain productive? In what ways do fungi adapt to their environments? How do single-celled organisms lead their lives?
From biomolecules to the biosphere, the Biological Sciences consider life in all forms. As the most broadly based Biological Sciences program, this degree will provide you with a marketable set of transferrable skills upon graduation. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in class, during tutorials, and in the laboratory.
Career opportunities
​Biologists have career opportunities in areas such as environmental management and conservation, scientific research, biotechnology, and more. A degree in Biological Sciences can be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or to another professional degree such as dentistry, medicine, veterinary medicine, or education.
Program highlights
Collaborative team work - Interact with your peers while learning to collaborate on projects.
Lab work - Learn how to use tools and develop techniques within a supervised laboratory setting.
Study abroad opportunities - Cultural and academic experiences at destinations around the world.
Courses in this program
Foundations of Chemistry (Structure and Bonding), General Chemistry (Structure and Bonding), Introductory Calculus, Linear Methods I, ​Energy Flow in Biological Systems

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
Early in my undergraduate career, I received outstanding support from Student Accessibility Services and met inspiring and passionate professors. They showed me how powerful it is to give someone the opportunity to succeed. I knew that if I worked hard and kept a constant focus on my goal of studying paleontology, anything could be possible. For me, studying paleontology is about uncovering the past and preserving current and future generations so we may prevent species declines in the future.
