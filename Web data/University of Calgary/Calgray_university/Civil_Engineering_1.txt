Why choose Civil Engineering?
Civil engineers ask questions such as: How can suspension bridges hold so much weight? Are there better ways to predict avalanches? How do skyscrapers withstand earthquakes?
Civil engineering involves the conception, design, construction, operation, maintenance and management of many structures and systems vital to the public. Civil engineering is a very broad discipline, which means the techniques and skills you’ll gain will be directly applicable to a wide range of real world work environments. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur in class, during tutorials, and through the completion of a full-year design project.
This fully accredited program features a common first year, which consists of 10 courses in mathematics, sciences, computing, engineering principles, communications and design. These courses will provide you with a solid foundation for your engineering training and introduce you to a variety of engineering disciplines. You'll apply for admission to a specific engineering program at the end of your first year.
Career opportunities
​As a civil engineer, you’ll have global opportunities to work in areas such as biomedicine, scientific research, transportation, and more. A degree in engineering can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or a professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or architecture.
Program highlights
Collaborative team work - Interact with your peers while learning to collaborate on projects.
Engineering Career Centre – Access engineering career advisors and gain valuable full-time paid engineering work experience through a 12-16 month placement.
Study abroad opportunities - Cultural and academic experiences at destinations around the world.

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
Civil engineering gives a broad, well-rounded selection of courses to choose from. They give you a good grounding in all the different fundamentals, which is great because a lot of the times you’re going out in the world where you think you’re going to do something, and then you end up doing something that’s completely different from what you expected. Having that strong foundation is really key.
