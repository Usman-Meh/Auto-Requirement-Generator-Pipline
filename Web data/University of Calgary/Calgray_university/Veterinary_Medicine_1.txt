Why choose Veterinary Medicine?
As a student at UCVM, one of Canada’s five veterinary colleges, you'll receive a comprehensive veterinary education and be able to select from one of the college's areas of emphasis. You'll begin working with live animals early in the program, and have numerous on-campus and off-site learning opportunities over the course of your four years of study. You can't enter the DVM program directly from high school. You must complete at least two years of university education and specific required courses to apply to this highly competitive program. The most up-to-date admission requirements can be found at
