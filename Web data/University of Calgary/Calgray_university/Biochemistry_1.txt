Bachelor of Science (BSc)
Learn how to apply for admission
Why choose Biochemistry?
Biochemists ask questions such as: How do fireflies create light and how can this bioluminescence be used as a research tool? What causes mad cow disease and how can this disease be cured? How can some bacteria thrive in boiling temperatures?
Biochemists are curious about how and why biological processes happen, and they research answers down to the molecular level. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in class, during tutorials, and in the laboratory. This degree will provide you with an understanding of the theory and practical use of current techniques used in biochemical research, and will give you an understanding of newly evolving fields such as bioinformatics and functional proteomics.
Career opportunities
​Biochemists have global opportunities to work in areas such as biotechnology, toxicology, clinical chemistry, animal science, and more. A degree in Biochemistry can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or a professional degree such as pharmacy, medicine, teaching, veterinary medicine, or law.

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
​My undergraduate education and graduate studies training at the University of Calgary set me up to become a leader in my field. My biochemistry education stressed the foundations of concepts and knowledge in chemistry and did not just spoon-feed me facts, which was key for me to become an independent thinker which and led me towards new discoveries in science. I frequently reflect on the excellent mentoring I received early in my training from the faculty at this university.
