Course-based program
Start your application
Program overview
The course-based LLM program is designed for those seeking to deepen their knowledge of a particular area of law, whether for professional or academic reasons. Students take courses and complete a major research paper on a topic of their choice. The course-based LLM will also appeal to internationally-trained lawyers who seek an introduction to the Canadian legal system, although it is not usually especially helpful for students seeking to satisfy the
National Committee of Accreditation’s requirements for legal practice in Canada
. The program can be completed on either a full-time or a part-time basis. Full-time students should expect to complete their programs in 12-16 months. A specialization in Natural Resources, Energy and Environmental Law (NREEL) is available. Admission to this program is highly competitive: meeting the minimum requirements does not guarantee admission.
The Faculty of Law has a wide range of research expertise. We have long been leaders in natural resources, energy and environmental law. Other areas of particular research strength include business and tax law, private law, administrative law and regulation, criminal law, Indigenous people and law, international law, human rights law, legal history and theory, and the law pertaining to privacy, security and technology. The Faculty of Law is a home of the Journal of Environmental Law and Practice and for our  acclaimed law blog, ABlawg.
Our LLM program was included in the LLM Guide's top 10 energy law programs worldwide (2019). Our program earns this recognition for strengths in examining the relationship between society and the environment, in defining the interests we claim in the world around us, and in shaping the consequences of using those resources. The faculty has endowed chairs in natural resources law, in business law, and in business regulation. Our substantial law library complemented by the internationally-renowned Canadian Institute of Resources Law, which hosts symposia and publishes research on natural resources and energy law.
