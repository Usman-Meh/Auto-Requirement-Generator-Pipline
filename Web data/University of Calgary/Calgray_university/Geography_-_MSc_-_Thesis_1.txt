Program overview
Engage in deep scholarship on the relationships between spaces, people and places. Graduate students admitted into the Geography program join a community of internationally recognized scholars offering one-on-one supervision and small graduate seminars. The program offers a judicious mix of course work and investigation that is tailored to meet the needs of each student's research endeavour. Faculty have extensive experience with physical and human geography, as well as geographic methods. With a campus located in Alberta's open prairies at the foot of the stunning Rocky Mountains, the University of Calgary offers students an incomparable location to pursue advanced study in Geography.
Students are normally admitted to the Fall term. However, off-cycle admissions may also be considered on an individual basis but will require alternate funding arrangements. Program funding will only be distributed in the competition for Fall admissions. Please contact the program for details.
