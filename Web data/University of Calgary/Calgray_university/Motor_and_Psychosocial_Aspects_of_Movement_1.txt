Why choose Motor and Psychosocial Aspects of Movement?
Motor and Psychosocial Aspects of Movement scholars ask questions such as: What factors affect human behaviour? How do memory and decision making impact human performance? Can understanding personality traits enhance team building?
Motor and Psychosocial Aspects of Movement is the study of the neural, cognitive and psycho-social concepts to try to understand human behaviour in physical activity, sport and health. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in class and during labs. You’ll learn approaches that researchers and practitioners in these fields use to describe, explain, predict and manage human behaviour.
Career opportunities
Motor and Psychosocial Aspects of Movement graduates have global opportunities to work in areas such as sport medicine and rehabilitation, recreation, health and fitness, research and more. A degree in Motor and Psychosocial Aspects of Movement can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or architecture.
