Why choose Natural Sciences?
Natural Sciences scholars ask questions such as: What is the future of augmented reality? Why do continents move? Can used nuclear fuel be recycled?
The Natural Sciences degree option is an innovative, multidisciplinary program that allows you to concentrate on two of the following specialties offered by the faculty of science: Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geoscience, Mathematics, and/or Physics. The depth of your first concentration will provide you with expertise in one area of science, while the breadth of your second concentration will help you solve multidisciplinary research problems. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in class, during tutorials, and in the laboratory.
Career opportunities
​As a Natural Sciences graduate, your career options will greatly depend on your own interests, as well as the academic and professional experience you gain while pursuing your degree. A degree in Natural Sciences can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or a professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or architecture.
