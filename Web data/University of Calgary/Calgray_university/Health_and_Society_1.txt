Learn how to apply for admission
Why choose Health and Society?
Health and Society scholars ask questions such as: How does poverty or wealth impact health? Can health care be equitable, ethical and efficient? What is the impact of climate change on health?
Health and Society combines social and health sciences to ask and answer crucial questions about health and well-being. During the course of your studies, much of your learning will occur while actively working on problems in class, during tutorials and in research settings. You’ll study individuals, populations, systems and ideas in order to address issues such as health promotion, disease prevention, social change, patient care and building better health systems locally and globally.
Career opportunities
​This one-of-a-kind interdisciplinary program involves social scientists, epidemiologists, public health specialists and a variety of other health researchers. With a degree in Health and Society, you’ll have global opportunities to work in both governmental and non-governmental agencies, in health care systems and more. This degree can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, or public health.

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
I completed both my BHSc and MD degrees at UCalgary. The BHSc program cultivated a supportive community where every student mattered. Small class sizes, an emphasis on scientific inquiry and our shared passion for social justice made for engaging classroom discussions and collaborations. These experiences honed my understanding of the social determinants of health, my critical thinking abilities and teamwork skills – all of which have been invaluable during medical school and residency.
