Program overview
Learn from internationally recognized scholars in a program with excellent student-to-supervisor ratios. Departmental expertise is wide-ranging; our historians are specialists in histories of Africa, Canada, China, Europe, Latin America and the United States. Students learn valuable skills in argumentative writing, critical thinking, public speaking, and grant proposal writing. After a year of seminar course work, students complete a research thesis. Typically, students base their theses in archival research within Canada and abroad. While many students go on to train at the PhD level, others move into research consulting and public history, or use their skills to transition into professions such as teaching, law, or the public service.
A specialization in History and Philosophy of Science is offered in cooperation with the Department of Philosophy.
