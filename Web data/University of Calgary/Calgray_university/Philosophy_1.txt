Philosophy
Bachelor of Arts (BA)
Learn how to apply for admission
Why choose Philosophy?
Philosophers ask questions such as: Is the mind distinct from the body? Can I know there is a world outside my mind? Does God exist?
Philosophy asks fundamental questions about ourselves, the world, and our place within it. As a philosophy student, you'll learn how to think, discuss and write about abstract ideas. During the course of your studies, you'll gain abstract reasoning skills, conceptual analysis capabilities, written and verbal communication skills, and logical abilities.
Career opportunities
As a Philosophy graduate, you'll be prepared for career opportunities in areas such as the civil service, the non-profit sector, and the business world. A degree in Philosophy can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies or another professional degree such as law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or education.​

Program description and courses (Course Calendar)
When I teach I bring two elements to my classroom: a diversity of issues, perspectives and philosophers beyond the Western tradition; and lessons on crafting an academic paper. Students are well served by studying philosophy. It teaches critical reasoning important in all walks of life. At UCalgary you’ll find enthusiastic and compassionate faculty dedicated to student success.
