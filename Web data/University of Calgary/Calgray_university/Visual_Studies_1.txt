Why choose Visual Studies?
Visual Studies students explore practices with visual media and materials through questions such as: How did Andy Warhol help popularize serigraphy? What role does art play in children’s learning? How can I use new digital technologies such as 3D printing to extend more traditional artistic practices like bronze casting?
Visual Studies is the program for you if you are interested in making or viewing art, are interested in thinking with materials or in experiencing visual media as a form of inquiry and knowledge. In this program you will focus on improving your technical skills and your self-sufficiency as an artist while learning how art and visual practices contribute to culture and community engagement. During the course of your studies you will develop visual thinking and critical research skills, written and verbal fluency in discussing historical and contemporary art practices, along with rigorous conceptual and medium specific visual studies training.
Career opportunities
​As a Visual Studies graduate, you'll be prepared for career opportunities in areas such as the non-profit sector, public museums and private art galleries, commercial photography or design, art gallery assistant or technician and interior design. A Visual Studies degree can also be used as a stepping-stone to graduate studies in visual art or another professional degree such as architecture, design, art therapy, or education.
