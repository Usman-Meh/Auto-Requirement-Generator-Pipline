CMR - Cardiac magnetic resonance acquisition techniques
Not activated for the a.y. 2024/2025.
The
Master in
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance
trains radiology technicians in the execution of specialist exams, by providing theoretical-practical training aimed at optimizing the resources and potential of diagnostic methods.
These objectives are reached through online lessons and hands-on practice, with the purpose of preparing patients for the exam, managing sequences, and optimizing the diagnostic protocol based on the clinical question.
Formative content
The
Master in Cardiac Magnetic Resonance
provides in-depth knowledge on the topic, starting from anatomy and cardiovascular physiology notions, to then explore cardiac magnetic resonance in detail, as an
extremely relevant
tool in the heart disease patient’s diagnostic path, while keeping in mind any contraindications.
Beneficiaries and employment opportunities
The
Master in Cardiac Magnetic Resonance
trains healthcare professionals, highly specialized in the use of cardiac magnetic resonance equipment, and in managing and optimizing the protocol, based on the clinical question. The course trains
expert professionals, independent
in managing instruments, patients and diagnoses.
Access to the Master is subordinate to the evaluation of the titles submitted by applicants (resume, dissertation, publications, and other titles deemed useful for the selection).
Programme
The
Master in Cardiac Magnetic Resonance
is a specialist course that deals with several modules:
Module 1 – CARDIOVASCULAR ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY
Introduction to cardiovascular anatomy and physiology.
Module 2 – CLINICAL INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS IN THE EXECUTION OF CARDIAC MAGNETIC RESONANCE
Clinical indications and potential within the heart disease patient’s diagnostic path; contraindications in the execution of a cardiac magnetic resonance.
Module 3 – PREPARING A PATIENT TO A CARDIAC MAGNETIC RESONANCE
Managing heart disease patients eligible for cardiac magnetic resonance.
Module 4 – PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES AND SIGNAL ACQUISITION IN CARDIAC MAGNETIC RESONANCE

Module 7 – FUNCTIONAL STUDY TECHNIQUES IN CARDIAC MAGNETIC RESONANCE
Indications, execution and clinical applications in functional study techniques.
Module 8 – TISSUE CHARACTERIZATION IN CARDIAC MAGNETIC RESONANCE
Indications, execution and clinical applications in tissue characterization.
Module 9 – STUDY OF TRANS-VALVULAR AND LARGE VESSEL FLOWS IN CARDIAC MAGNETIC RESONANCE
Indications, execution and clinical applications in the study of trans-valvular and large vessel flows.
Module 10 – CARDIAC MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
Indications, execution and clinical applications in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
Module 11 – STRESS-RELATED CARDIAC MAGNETIC RESONANCE
Indications, execution and clinical applications in stress-related cardiac magnetic resonance.
Module 12 – SAFETY AND CONTRAST MEDIA IN CARDIAC MAGNETIC RESONANCE
Introduction to the safety procedures applied in cardiac magnetic resonance. Characteristics, administration methods and contraindications of contract media in cardiac magnetic resonance.
Module 13 –
DEDICATED STUDY PROTOCOLS BASED ON THE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES
Definition of specific protocols based on the cardiovascular disease.
Module 14 – EXTRA-CARDIAC COLLATERAL FINDS
Identification and recognition of extra-cardiac collateral finds.
Module 15 – MANAGING HEART DISEASE PATIENTS WITH INTRACARDIAC DEVICE
Management and optimization of the cardiac magnetic resonance study protocol in patients with intracardiac device.
Module 16 – PITFALLS IN THE EXECUTION OF CARDIAC MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
Identification and correction of the most common pitfalls in the acquisition of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
Module 17 – POST-PROCESSING OF CARDIAC MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
Introduction to the post-processing of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

FAQ
What are the selection criteria to access the Master's Degree?
The titles submitted by applicants will be evaluated during the selection process. In particular, the following scores will be attributed:
Resume: up to 70 points
Dissertation: up to 10 points
Publications: up to 10 points
Other titles deemed useful by the applicant: up to 10 points
How will the distance learning course be structured?
After enrolling in the Master course, students will be granted access to an online platform, to follow the lessons, hands-on practice and seminars. Online lessons will be interactive to promote the participation of each student. At the end of each lesson, practice or seminars, students may ask questions to clarify any doubt directly to the professor. The lessons of the Master in Cardiac Magnetic Resonance are carried out online, in asynchronous mode.
Attendance to the Master is mandatory, and students must attend at least 80% of the lessons. Moreover, students are prompted to take part in hands-on practice sessions and seminars online, to deepen their knowledge on cardiac magnetic resonance, sequence acquisition techniques, pathology-based diagnostic protocols, and post-processing phases.
The final exam will consist of an exam protocol based on a clinical case, in order to assess the student’s ability to optimize the diagnostic method potential.
There will be no care activities on patients, since the entire course will be held only online.
Will there be an internship at the end of the Master?
The Master does not include any care activities on patients. Hands-on practice will be carried out through online sessions, supervised by a tutor, who will guide students in the post-processing and interpretation of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. At the end of each practice session, students may ask questions and interact directly with the professor.
Will there be any forms of facilitations?
An enrolment contribution equal to €600.00 is reserved to DAC students. Unfortunately, no scholarships will be provided.
What are the minimum attendance requirements?
Attendance to the Master in Cardiac Magnetic Resonance is mandatory; students are required to attend at least 80% of the lessons. Active participation in lessons, hands-on practice and seminars is highly encouraged in order to consolidate the notions learned through the Master.
