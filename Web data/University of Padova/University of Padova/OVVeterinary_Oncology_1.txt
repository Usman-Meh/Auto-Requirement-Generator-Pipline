OV - Veterinary Oncology
The Second-level Short Specialisation Degree in Veterinary Oncology gives freelance veterinarians the opportunity to
improve their knowledge of oncological cases;
hone the skills needed to manage pet patients with various types of neoplasms;
come up with the right diagnostic algorithm for an accurate diagnosis of tumours in animals;
decide on gold-standard therapies for the most frequent tumours in veterinary practice and, when necessary,  understand where to refer the most complex cases.
Furthermore, the Master’s course also teaches students how to establish
constructive channels of communication
with animal owners about the condition of their pets, the frequent need for chronic therapy that takes the quality of life of the animal into consideration, and supporting patient and owner until the end of the animal’s life.
Educational content
The Second-level Short Specialisation Degree in Veterinary Oncology focuses on acquiring knowledge about:
the general biology of neoplasms in animals;
principles of communication and ethics in veterinary oncology;
the main cytological, histological, and clinical diagnostic techniques;
pharmacological aspects and use of the main antineoplastic drugs;
the classification, diagnosis and therapeutic options of the most frequent neoplasms in veterinary practice.
Target and career opportunities
The Second-level Short Specialisation Degree in Veterinary Oncology is intended to offer in-depth information and provide updated knowledge to veterinary doctors who are already working in a freelance capacity with small animals.
In order to get the most out of the Master’s course and to achieve the expected learning outcomes, the student should already have knowledge in line with European veterinary medicine degrees (
day-one competencies
of EAEVE SOP:
https://www.eaeve.org/esevt/sop.html
).
Therefore, at the end of the course, students will have
increased their skill level
, and be better able to
identify and diagnose animal tumours
and to choose and administer the best available
therapies.
Practical exercises focused on cytological and imaging diagnostics will also further increase students’ skills.

FAQ
How will the courses be structured?
Classes will be held over Zoom (synchronous lessons) and will include presentations that can be downloaded on demand. Theoretical lectures and practical activities take place over five weeks during the academic year, and courses are provided in English by lecturers and freelance professionals from Italy and abroad.
For more in-depth knowledge about the topics discussed in the seminars, additional teaching materials – with updated information from the international scientific community – will be provided online. At the end of each week, there will be a learning check to test the student’s knowledge.
During the Master’s course, the student will be given project work focused on going further in-depth from a scientific standpoint, describing an oncological case.
The final examination will focus on the knowledge acquired and the discussion of the project work.
