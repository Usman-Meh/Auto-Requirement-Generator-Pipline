EPCA - Arrhythmology and Electrophysiology in pediatric age and in adult with congenital heart diseas
The
Master in Arrhythmology and Electrophysiology in Paediatric and Adult Congenital Patients
delves into the knowledge of congenital, acquired and genetic arrhythmic diseases, and the latest diagnostic and treatment techniques for their diagnosis and treatment.
Through an
electrocardiographic, physiopathological and electrophysiological approach
, the course analyses all arrhythmic diseases from the gestational age to adults with congenital heart disease, and sets the foundations for their diagnosis.
It also covers all diagnostic techniques for risk stratification, and the possible pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment strategies. Lastly, it explores how to manage arrhythmic urgencies from the gestational age to adults with congenital heart disease.
Formative content
The
Master in Arrhythmology and Electrophysiology in Paediatric and Adult Congenital Patient
trains professional figures with advances skills, who are familiar with and recognize the different arrhythmic situations in paediatric and adult congenital patients, and who can analyse the context within its anatomical and physiopathological complexity, while understanding commonly employed scientific and technical language.
Students learn how to recognize individual clinical and physiopathological situations, in order to identify the proper treatment strategy, and manage
patients
independently. Also, they will learn how to coordinate with the other professional figures working at the hospital, to come up with synergistic intervention processes and elaborate on and process arrhythmic clinical cases.
Lastly, the
Master in Arrhythmology and Electrophysiology in Paediatric and Adult Congenital Patient
teaches students how to communicate in a clear, articulated way, with the correct technical-scientific terms with field specialists (electrophysiologists, paediatricians, paediatric cardiologist, cardiosurgeon).
Beneficiaries and employment opportunities
The
Master in Arrhythmology and Electrophysiology in Paediatric and Adult Congenital Patient
is addressed to cardiologists, paediatricians and anaesthesiologists, and the knowledge acquired will help them gain the proper skills to recognize and manage arrhythmia in paediatric and adult patients with congenital cardiac disease at clinical, intervention and urgency level.
Following clinical training, the professional figures, such as paediatric cardiologists, adult cardiologists, anaesthesiologists, neonatologists, emergency medicine doctors, sports doctors
will recognize and manage
cardiac arrhythmia in paediatric and
in
adult congenital patients independently, will manage arrhythmia emergencies relating to these aspects,
and also intervention electrophysiology
to treat those pathologies, based on scientific evidence.

FAQ
How will the course be structured?
Students have a mandatory attendance of one year, including lessons, periodic seminars and an internship.
Their learning skills are tested with a written mid-year exam, useful to highlight any deficiencies that may be bridged over the rest of the year.
The Master is held in twelve months, and is articulated in lessons and in an internship, during which students will have access to the electrophysiology hall and to the paediatric and congenital heart disease patient electrophysiology clinic.
Attendance is mandatory, and the dates of the lessons will be communicated once a month. Attendance is taken with the students’ signature. The internship period will be agreed on an individual basis. At the end of the course, the students’ satisfaction will be surveyed.
How is the internship structured?
During the internship, students will attend the paediatric and congenital heart disease patient electrophysiology clinic, paediatric meetings and GUCh, where the arrhythmia cases are discussed, and the electrophysiology lab to consolidate the notions learned on the different arrhythmia conditions, and learn how to perform intervention electrophysiology procedures.
The internship period will be agreed on an individual basis.
What are the minimum attendance requirements?
The course has a mandatory attendance of at least 70% of the activities.
