DMM - Digital Media Marketing for SMEs
Having a digital marketing strategy is crucial for the competitiveness of SMEs. In Italy, the B2C market has exceeded €40 billion and B2B accounts for over 20% of the total. 41.6% of SMEs make advanced use of digital technologies. 6 out of 10 are looking for digital skills, but 45.6% find it difficult to recruit them. The Advanced Training Course in Digital Media Marketing for SMEs of the University of Padua aims to reduce this gap by training Junior Digital Media Managers capable of managing the digital communication channels of SMEs. At the end of the course, participants will be able to collaborate with the marketing manager in defining and managing a digital marketing strategy, developing and managing content marketing, optimising content in digital channels, measuring and analysing digital marketing actions, and implementing continuous improvement actions.
Content Outline
The Advanced Training Course in Digital Marketing for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises is characterised by the organic integration of theory and practice. The lessons are structured as follows:
In the first part, the methodological and analytical foundations necessary to carry out the activities are introduced. For example, with regard to strategic auditing, the contents of an auditing report are defined and all activities necessary for its production are explained.
The second part of the course focuses on the practical component, through the analysis of case histories and the development of simulations based on briefs provided by the lecturer.
