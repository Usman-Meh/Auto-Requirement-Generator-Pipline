MFUI - Myofascial ultrasound imaging
The
Post-Graduate Course in Myofascial Ultrasounds
prepares students on this crucial area of contemporary musculoskeletal diagnostic, which holds a central role in anatomical analysis and in the assessment of muscle and fascia conditions.
Purpose of this Course is providing a thorough theoretical and practical foundation, starting from basic myofascial anatomy and ultrasound concepts, and exploring advanced scanning techniques. By providing a detailed analysis of musculoskeletal issues connected to myofascial alterations, they can be identified through specific ultrasound characteristics.
Particular emphasis is placed on the
advanced imaging interpretation
to ensure an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The Course is not restricted to the acquisition of theoretical knowledge, it also trains students in the hands-on application of competences in clinical and diagnostic settings.
Educational content
The
Post-Graduate Course in Myofascial Ultrasounds
provides a thorough
and hands-on knowledge of myofascial ultrasound techniques, through diversified educational methods
. The lessons provide a solid base on the anatomical, physiological and technical aspects of ultrasounds, while hands-on sessions help students acquire technical and imaging interpretation skills. The workshops are the perfect occasion to correlate ultrasound and anatomy on corpses. Moreover, the hands-on sessions with volunteers represent the chance to carry out actual examinations, under the supervision of expert trainers, to practice carrying out the exams. Particular attention is devoted to anatomical dissection, to
study myofascial anatomy in detail
and identify the relevant structures. Lastly, the project work covers several topics, such as: myofascial anatomy and physiology, ultrasound techniques, imaging interpretation, musculoskeletal pathologies, and ethical, legal, research and innovation aspects.
Target and careen opportunities
The
Post-Graduate Course in Myofascial Ultrasounds
is addressed to Medicine and Surgery graduates, who wish to perfect themselves in the ultrasound diagnostic of musculoskeletal pathologies with myofascial involvement; the closest career is that of musculoskeletal sonographer.
Practical applications in this course range from physical therapy and rehabilitation, orthopaedics, rheumatology, anaesthesiology and pain therapy, and sports medicine. Moreover, it trains students to actively contribute to clinical research and education on myofascial ultrasounds.
The academic competences acquired include
mastering advanced ultrasound imaging acquisition and interpretation
,
being able to distinguish and assessing different myofascial pathologies
, and understanding myofascial anatomy and its clinical implications in detail. The course also provides hands-on skills on diagnostic and treatment procedures, and on how to manage ultrasound equipment and related data effectively.
