CoVa - Modern approach to patient management with connective tissue disease, vasculitis and autoinflammatory disease
The
Second-level short specialisation degree
in
Modern approach to patient management with connective tissue disease, vasculitis and autoinflammatory disease
prepares doctors – preferably rheumatology specialists – on the advanced clinical management of systemic rheumatology diseases, based on the latest scientific findings.
The purpose of the course is training professionals in the diagnosis and treatment of the main clinical manifestations, i.e. connective tissue disease and vasculitis, so as to help them manage this kind of patients independently, both in hospital and clinical settings.
Educational content
The
Second-level short specialisation degree
in
Modern approach to patient management with connective tissue disease, vasculitis and autoinflammatory disease
provides, for each disease covered, the discussion of the etiopathogenetic, clinical (including lab testing, imaging and autoantibodies), diagnostic, diagnostic-differential, and treatment aspects, also with reference to consolidated and emerging indications on treatment with biotechnological and small-molecule drugs.
The
Short specialisation degree
is divided in theoretical lessons and clinical activity. The diseases covered by the
Short specialisation degree
and by the clinical activity include: systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, Sjögren syndrome, undifferentiated connective tissue diseases, antiphospholipid antibodies syndrome, vasculitis of small, medium and large vessels.
Course target and career opportunities
The
Second-level short specialisation degree
in
Modern approach to patient management with connective tissue disease, vasculitis and autoinflammatory disease
is addressed to graduates in Medicine and Surgery, preferably with a specialization in Rheumatology, who wish to acquire
specific competence
in how to manage patients suffering from systemic rheumatology diseases. At the end of the
Short specialisation degree
, students may fully and professionally find work in third-party facilities as
medical executives
, or as
expert interlocutors
in spoke centres, in connection with hub centres.
Short specialisation degree
students can also work in
clinical contexts
, both inside and outside hospitals, and may also be part of care networks, in partnership with third-level centres. The
Short specialisation degree
also
helps to improve the capacity of critically assessing
existing national/international guidelines or good practices, and literature updates on connective tissue diseases and vasculitis.
Course program
The
Second-level short specialisation degree
in
Modern approach to patient management with connective tissue disease, vasculitis and autoinflammatory disease
provides in-depth training on the following diseases:
CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASES

SYSTEMIC VASCULITIS
Takayasu disease
Giant cell arteritis
Polyarteritis nodosa
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis

Admission and teaching mode
The
Short specialisation degree
course includes in-classroom lessons and clinical activity with attendance of dedicated clinics.
In-classroom lessons
will be concentrated in 3 weeks (possibly from Thursday to Saturday), indicatively in the months of December 2024, February 2025 and May 2025. They will be held by university professors, mostly belonging to the Rheumatology Unit of the Padua University/Hospital.
Clinical practice
will be distributed between December 2024-September 2025.
Short specialisation degree
students will actively take part in the clinical practice in dedicated clinics. Moreover, students will have the option of attending
meetings
where the situation of the in-patients of the AOPD Rheumatology Unit will be discussed. Lastly, there will be meetings where students will present one or more medical cases covered during the clinical activity, with scientific evidence on the topic. The medical cases will then be
discussed jointly.
FURTHER TRAINING ACTIVITIES
Students will also take part in the consolidated Rheumatology Unit training activities:
Rheumatology Meetings
: 12 meetings held on Wednesday, between 5:30 and 7:30 PM. They will cover the hot topics related to rheumatology diseases. Students are required to take part in the meetings concerning connective tissue diseases and vasculitis (around 4-5). Over the last years, this activity has been carried out through webinars.
Excellence Conference
: annual conference covering some cross-sectional aspects of connective tissue diseases and vasculitis. It is held in person, on two dates (Thursday and Friday or Friday and Saturday). The last editions were held around the end of April.
General ranking of merit
The general ranking of merit for the academic year 2024/25 will be published on the Italian page of this Second-level short specialisation degree according to the timing provided in the Call.
