PPE - Paediatric psychology (0-6)
The
Course in Paediatric Psychology (0-6)
is aimed at providing theoretical and practical knowledge on typical and atypical development, to promote the well-being of children of preschool age.
Prevention, assessment and early intervention
in early ages, starting from pregnancy to the 0-6 age interval, are primary healthcare objectives, therefore it is increasingly necessary to train figures experts on these topics, in an integrated multidisciplinary view.
The Course wants to provide, based on the related background, the right competencies in using methods and instruments to assess the different developmental aspects (neurocognitive, motorial, emotional, relational), with the aim of being capable of
planning and implementing specific interventions
with children between 0 and 6 years of age and their families, by integrating different professional competencies (psychology, gynaecology, paediatrics, child neuropsychiatry).
