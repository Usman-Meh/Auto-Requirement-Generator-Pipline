TIC - Cardiac intensive care
The Master joins the second extraordinary pre-enrolment term from the 4th to the 25th November 2024, 12.30 pm
Our
Short Specialization Degree in
Cardiac intensive care
is aimed at mastering the theoretical and practical skills needed when managing patients in cardiac intensive care.
Following a pathophysiological approach, our course focuses on the use of technical equipment generally used in cardiac intensive care.
The general concepts of patient management in the cardiology intensive care unit will be illustrated: cardiovascular monitoring and diagnostics in the acute cardiology patient, drug therapy and management of mechanical supports in the critical cardiology patient. Aspects related to the use of the technological equipment normally used in the cardiological intensive care unit are then examined in depth.
Educational content
Our
Short Specialization Degree in
Cardiac intensive care
is aimed at training professionals to autonomously perform the following tasks:
Performing and interpretating instrumental examinations for acute cardiologic patients
Obtaining and reading critical patients’ hemodynamic data
Establishing the diagnosis and treatment of patients in cardiac intensive care
Choosing the optimal therapy for the critical cardiology patient
Course target and career opportunities
Our
Short Specialization Degree in
Cardiac intensive care
is addressed to doctors and aimed at training professionals who will be able to deal with major acute cardiovascular diseases and critical cardiologic patients based on an appropriate process of diagnosis and treatment.
Students will have the chance to improve their interaction skills with cardiologists who work in intensive care, anesthetists, and heart surgeons during the treatment of acute cardiologic patients. They will also have the chance to seek career opportunities in dedicated wards/departments.
With our Short Specialization Degree, students will also learn how to:
Assess
international guidelines and constant updates of dedicated literature in the field of cardiac intensive care
Perform and interpret
instrumental examinations for acute cardiologic patients
Obtain and read
critical patients’ hemodynamic data
The ability to choose and modulate
the most appropriate therapy in the critical cardiology patient.
The
Short Specialization Degree in Cardiology Intensive Care
aims to train high-level professionals who can, operationally, implement all the main skills in the diagnostic framing and clinical and therapeutic management of the critical cardiology patient and in particular of the patient with decompensation in its most advanced forms up to the patient who is a candidate for left ventricular assistance and heart transplantation.
