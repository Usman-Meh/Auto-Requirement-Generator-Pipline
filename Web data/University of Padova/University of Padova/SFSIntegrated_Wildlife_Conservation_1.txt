SFS - Integrated Wildlife Conservation
The Master joins the second extraordinary pre-enrolment term from the 4th to the 25th November 2024, 12.30 pm
Our
Short Specialization Degree in Integrated Wildlife Conservation
trains figures specialized in the protection and management of land and water wild fauna. Attendees will develop an integrated theoretical and technical/practical
One Health approach
, to manage wild animals and species/habitat preservation projects, in a sustainability and local conflict management perspective.
Participation of international scholars ensures a holistic and multidisciplinary vision to
manage data, information and researches on preservation.
Furthermore, it provides the cultural means to explore the
human dimension
and draft management, preservation and communication plans. The course will provide the appropriate skills to intervene during the different phases of preservation projects, from planning to implementation and promulgation, by pursuing
research, welfare and local sustainability goals.
Educational content
Our Short Specialization Degree in Integrated Wildlife Conservation
provides training on three main areas:
Integrated biodiversity preservation
Research, animal welfare and sustainability
Human dimension and conflict management, regulations, ethics and communication
In the first part of the course, lessons will be held online, on Friday and Saturday every other week, on e-learning platforms. In the second part of the course, there will be in-person hands-on lessons, workshops and practice (on weekends or during residential weeks).
Training activities may be held at UNIPD facilities, or in partner institutions (zoos/parks/research institutes).
At the end of the course, students will be required to
develop an integrated preservation project
, comprising active experimentation, according to the methods learned during the course. It can also be a group project.
Course target and career opportunities
The
Short Specialization Degree in Integrated Wildlife Conservation
is open to anyone with a first-level degree, interested in land and sea wild animal preservation and biodiversity protection. The course is also indicated for professionals, such as biologists, zoologists, naturalists, veterinarians, agronomists, working in the Nature preservation field.
The Master provides students with competences to work in the field of
biodiversity protection in a One-Health perspective
