CLO - Customized Lingual Orthodontics
The
Master in Customized Lingual Orthodontics
prepares students to manage an orthodontics case with a customized buccal and lingual technique.
The purpose of this course is helping professionals achieve the correct diagnosis independently, and program a suitable
treatment plan
for simple and complex
clinical cases
. Particular emphasis is given to the clinical management of multidisciplinary cases.
The course will include classroom lessons and specific in-depth modules on peculiar topics, such as the treatment of Class II and Class III complex cases with non-compliance mechanics.
Educational content
The
Master in Customized Lingual Orthodontics
provides knowledge on direct bonding procedures, on the selection of the ideal archwire sequence, and on proper treatment mechanics, based on the patient’s malocclusion. Students will familiarize with scientific literature to understand the advantages of this technique compared to traditional buccal or removable aligner techniques. Moreover, they will learn how to use this technique on adolescent and adult patients, with high efficacy and aesthetic requests.
The course includes intensive classroom lessons, with
expert international lecturers
taking turns to teach all the characteristics of lingual braces and their different action phases. It will also include monthly lessons dealing with specific clinical topics and with the discussion of simple and complex clinical cases. In addition, students will have the chance to
present their clinical cases
and discuss them with the lecturers once a month, to analyse the technical and critical issues of the different operating phases.
Lastly, the Master course will include technical insights on lab procedures, useful to plan multidisciplinary cases, and will describe the different operating stages of mandibular propulsion systems.
Target and career opportunities
The Master in Customized Lingual Orthodontics
is addressed to specialists in orthodontics or orthodontists with experience in the lingual technique.
Students will learn how to gather excellent photographic documents, analyse x-rays, formulate the
correct diagnosis
, and suggest an
appropriate treatment plan
.
They will also learn how to manage indirect
bonding procedures
and different clinical
stages
, including stabilization and containment. The course provides specific competences on the multidisciplinary approach of adult patients with complex malocclusions.
By completing the Master course, students will have the chance of proposing themselves as
expert consultants in the aesthetic lingual technique
in dental clinics.
