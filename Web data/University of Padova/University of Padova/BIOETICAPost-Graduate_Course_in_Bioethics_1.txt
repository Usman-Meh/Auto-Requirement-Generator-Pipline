The
Post-Graduate Course in Bioethics, active for over 30 years
, is part of the post-graduate training initiatives offered by the University of Padua, and is designed to provide an introduction to bioethics in general, and specific competencies to employ in the professional field.
The Course provides training on the
ethical issues raised by biomedicine
, and discusses them in connection with the public debate, and by promoting comparison between different opinions. It also includes a
lab
where the theoretical prospective of academic researchers can interact with the experience and reflections of those engaged in care and research practices.
The Course has been activated upon proposal of the following
Departments
: Biology; Philosophy; Sociology; Pedagogy and Applied Psychology; Molecular Medicine (reference Department); Women and Child‚Äôs Health; Political Sciences, Legal Sciences and International Studies. The Course
Director
is Enrico Furlan, Moral Philosophy and Bioethics Researcher.
Educational content
The
Post-Graduate Course in Bioethics
is divided into
three modules
:
Bioethics: fundamental questions;
Bioethics and healthcare;
Bioethics and life sciences.
The Course includes two events organized annually:
Colloqui su bioetica e dignit√† umana
, by Corrado Viafora, and the
International Seminar on Ethical Issues in Medical Biotechnologies
, by the
Filosofia morale e Bioetica
research group of the Molecular Medicine Department.
The Course employs several
educational methods
:¬†lessons with debates, comparison between different opinions, in-depth seminars with experts, hands-on practice and group activities, clinical sessions.
During the opening session, attendees will receive the Course manual, which explains the conceptual horizon within which the training path evolves: C. Viafora, E. Furlan, S. Tusino (by),
Questioni di vita. Un‚Äôintroduzione alla bioetica
, FrancoAngeli, Milan 2019.
In addition, for each session,
the organizing secretariat will make available to the students, on the Moodle page of the course, other relevant materials and documentation.
The Course includes national and international professors, belonging to some of the most prestigious organizations and institutions in the bioethics field.

here
The
Post-Graduate Course in Bioethics
is divided into
three modules
, dedicated to:
BIOETHICS: FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS
The first module introduces attendees to the
moral reasoning structure
. This is done through a series of lessons and group activities, with the goal of presenting the most used ethical theories in the bioethical debate: utilitarianism, liberal theory, personalism. Particular attention is paid to the argumentative resources of the idea of
human dignity
, which inspired the ethical analysis methodology covered by the Course and applied within the clinical sessions of the second module. The same idea acts as background in the
comparison between the ethical theories
presented and the different positions supported on some of the emerging bioethical beginning- and end-of-life questions.
BIOETHICS AND HEALTHCARE
The second module is dedicated to exploring the context where bioethics has developed and continues to develop its most intense activity ‚Äì
healthcare
, with particular reference to the most ethically challenging areas:
oncological care, intensive care, long-term care and palliative care.
To tackle this task, the tool offered is clinical sessions, structured as such: characterization of the context that acts as background for clinical data, epidemiology trends, organizational aspects (by healthcare professionals with proven experience and competencies in the field); presentation of a clinical case taken by the related context to highlight the most recurring ethical issues, or those that have generated uncertainty, perplexity, doubts; presentation by bioethics and/or biolaw scholars of the framework where these issues are tackled; analysis and group discussion to discuss about the ethical issues raised by the case.
BIOETHICS AND LIFE SCIENCES
The third module is dedicated to the
ethical questions open by biotechnologies
, and resulting from the application of genetic engineering to human, animal and plant life. One specific aspect that will be covered is the relationship between
science autonomy and responsibility
, and, in broadest terms, between science and society. In light of this perspective, the following ethical questions will be analysed and discussed: regenerative medicine and stem cells; predictive medicine and genetic testing; ethical neuroscience implications; animal testing. The discussion on each one of these questions will comprise a scientific and a bioethical contribution.
