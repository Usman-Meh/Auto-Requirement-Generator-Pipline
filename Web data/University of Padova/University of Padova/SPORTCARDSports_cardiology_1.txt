SPORTCARD - Sports cardiology
Not activated for the a.y. 2024/2025
The course in Sports cardiology is offered in collaboration with the Department of Sports Medicine of Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.
The course
aims to provide theoretical and practical knowledge about the characteristics of the athlete’s heart and about diagnosis, risk stratification and clinical management of athletes with cardiovascular diseases.
It will also address exercise prescription, cardiac rehabilitation and management of cardiac emergencies in sport arenas.
The course aims to improve interaction skills with clinical cardiologists, electrophysiologist, interventionists and sports physicians involved in the multidisciplinary management of the athlete.
Formative content
The course will be held online (live streaming) and on-demand for a total number of 60 hours of teaching divided into 8-10 days (1 or 2 full-day per month). The administrative headquarter is the Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Sciences and Public Health, University of Padova, Italy.
The following topic will be covered during the training course:
Cardiovascular anatomy and physiology of the athlete;
Interpretation of cardiac examinations in the athlete;
Modifications secondary to the use of doping substances;
Modalities and effectiveness of screening for the identification of athletes with heart disease;
Clinical management of athletes affected by heart disease;
Epidemiology of sudden death and cardiac arrest on the sports arenas.
Students will also be assigned a project work (presentation of a clinical case) which will be discussed during the final exam.
Beneficiaries and employment opportunities
The Sports cardiology course is aimed at holders of a degree in medicine and surgery, a three-year university degree in health professions including prevention, rehabilitation and nursing.
The aim of the course is to train in the interpretation of cardiac examinations in athletes and in the clinical management of athletes with presumed cardiac disorder, increasing autonomy in the assessment of athletes suspected of having a cardiac disease and evaluation of sports eligibility.
The training will also enhance the ability to critically evaluate international guidelines and the continuous updating of the literature in the field of sports cardiology.
Programme
The Sports cardiology course includes the following subjects:
Introduction to sports cardiology and athlete’s heart:
Fundamentals of sports cardiology (what is sports cardiology and how does it contribute to the reduction of sudden death in athletes)
History of sports cardiology and differential diagnosis between athlete’s heart and cardiomyopathies
Physiology of the athlete’s heart (exercise physiology and cardiovascular remodelling in response to exercise)
Evaluation of athletes with suspected heart disease:
Athlete arrhythmias (evaluation and differential diagnosis of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in the athlete)
Evaluation of the athlete with suspected heart disease (indications and interpretation of ECG, Holter, stress test, cardiopulmonary test, echocardiogram and stress echocardiogram; indications and interpretations of cardiac MRI, SPECT and CT scan)
Management of athletes with heart disease
Management of the athlete with heart disease (management of the athlete with arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies and channelopathies; management of the athlete with congenital heart disease or valvular disease; assessment of the master athlete and management of the athlete with coronary artery disease)
Management of the athlete with a device (pacemaker or defibrillator) and resuscitation in the field.
General ranking of merit
The general ranking of merit for the academic year 2024/25 will be published on the Italian page of this Course according to the timing provided in the Call.
