TAPU - Advanced ureteral pathology treatment techniques
Not activated for AY 2024/2025.
The
Master’s Degree in Advanced Ureteral Pathology Treatment Techniques,
prepares doctors specialized in urology to acquire all the competencies in endo-urological diagnostic and operating procedures, aimed at treating the main ureteral pathologies in adults and children (congenital malformations, stenosis, stones, and ureteral neoplasms).
The course also explores all technical surgery innovations (open surgery and robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery) to solve the issues related to ureteral pathologies.
The Master’s Course provides all competencies to understand the diagnosis of ureteral pathologies in children and adults, and to apply the most suitable treatment solutions, in line with the most recent and advanced robot surgery and endo-urological techniques
Educational content
The course units of the Master’s Degree in Advanced Ureteral Pathology Treatment Techniques are developed through lesson cycles in short continuous periods, previously agreed between the professors and the attendees. The main competencies acquired include diagnostic understanding and solution of simple and complex congenital, acquired, benignant and malignant ureteral pathologies, in adults and children. Attendees are required to actively participate both in the discussion of the Master’s clinical cases, and in the critical rediscussion of the diagnostic and treatment procedures applied to the cases analysed, also by watching intra-surgery videos.
Course target and career opportunities
The
Master’s Degree in Advanced Ureteral Pathology Treatment Techniques
is addressed to doctors specialized in Urology. At the end of the training course, professionals will be able to implement the endo-urologic and robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery activities in their relevant settings.

FAQ
How will the teaching be organized?
The lessons will be held in-person only, to allow the attendees to take actively part in the endo-urology and robot surgery activities in the operating room, and then to critically replay the videos of the procedures they assisted with the operators. All the cases included in the Master’s Course, subjected to robot-assisted or open surgery laparoscopic endo-urological surgery, will be briefed in advance, to share indications and point out any issues related to the technique selected to solve the case.
How will hands-on practice be structured?
Traineeships and hands-on practice will be completed during the lesson period, for up to 4 days of hands-on activities for each cycle.
Traineeships and hands-on practice will be carried out in the operating room and endo-urological room of the urology clinic, at the University Hospital of Padua; the procedures will be carried out by surgeons recognized at national and international level, with decades-long experience.
When will the Master's Course activities be held?
All the Master’ activities will be held at the
Urology Clinic
of the University Hospital of Padua.
Is there a maximum absence threshold?
Attendance
of at least 70% of the hours is mandatory.
