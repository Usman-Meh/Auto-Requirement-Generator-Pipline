TESEO - Treatment of Advanced Heart Failure with Mechanical Circulation Support Systems
The
Second-level short specialisation degree
in Treatment of Advanced Heart Failure with Mechanical Circulation Support Systems
prepares professionals in the interpretation of instrumental exams and medical management of adult and paediatric subjects suffering from acute or chronic advanced heart failure, and holders of mechanical circulatory support devices.
Professionals are trained on indications, risk layering, materials and devices, implant techniques, intra-surgical management, post-surgery and follow-up of adult and paediatric patients suffering from acute or chronic heart disease, and in managing complications and emergencies, both in hospital and in territorial settings.
The purpose of the
Short specialisation degree
is provide theoretical and hands-on knowledge on this topic, and help students become independent in
assessing patients
with advanced heart disease and in
managing
patients with mechanical circulation support systems.
Educational content
The
Second-level short specialisation degree
in Treatment of Advanced Heart Failure with Mechanical Circulation Support Systems
provides specific training on the following topics:
Execution and interpretation of instrumental exams to
identify patients
suffering from advanced heart disease, and compatible with mechanical circulation support system treatments
Clinical assessment and
optimized timing
to refer patients with advanced heart disease compatible with mechanical circulation support systems
Participation in the
clinical management of adult and paediatric patients
suffering from acute or chronic advanced heart disease
Intra-surgery, post-surgery and follow-up management
of patients with mechanical circulation support
Management of the main complications and emergencies
in patients with mechanical circulation support
Sensitization of biomedical engineers
on advanced heart disease for the development of new devices
Course target and career opportunities
The
Second-level short specialisation degree
in Treatment of Advanced Heart Failure with Mechanical Circulation Support Systems
is addressed to surgeons and biomedical engineers engaged, on one side, in the cardiovascular assessment and clinical management of patients with mechanical circulation support devices, both in cardiology and heart surgery services, both as specialist consultants, and, on the other side, in the development of the devices.
The course provides highly specialized competences, which can be used in any context where there is the need to assess and manage advanced heart disease.
Course program
The
Second-level short specialisation degree
in Treatment of Advanced Heart Failure with Mechanical Circulation Support Systems
provides specific training on:

Antithrombotic treatment and
adverse events
related to haemocompatibility
Infective
complications
and how to manage them
Long-term clinical
follow-up
for patients with mechanical circulation support
The role of
psychological assessment
of patients with mechanical ventricular support and their caregiver
Admission and teaching mode
The
Second-level short specialisation degree
in Treatment of Advanced Heart Failure with Mechanical Circulation Support Systems
includes a one-year training course at the Cardiac Surgery UOC of the Padua University Hospital for
lectures
(lessons). Furthermore, participants will visit OR, intensive care, the VAD clinic and in-patient ward of the Cardiac Surgery UOC, at the Padua University Hospital, as
observers
. Lastly, the
Short specialisation degree
requires students to take part in a
seminary
on advanced heart disease surgical treatment. The
final exam
will consist in the presentation and discussion of an individual original or compiling research (dissertation).
General ranking of merit
The general ranking of merit for the academic year 2024/25 will be published on the Italian page of this Short specialisation degree according to the timing provided in the Call.
