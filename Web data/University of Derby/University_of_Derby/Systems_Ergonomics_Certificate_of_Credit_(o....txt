This course is an optional module within our online MSc Ergonomics and Human Factors and can be completed as a standalone 10-week course. You will gain 20 credits at level 7 with a Certificate of Credit to evidence your learning achievement.
It is ideally suited to nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, engineers or designers who have effectively studied ergonomics in some form at a local level but who wish to expand their knowledge to consider in a wider, macro-level context.
It considers macro-ergonomics and the organisational context of any situation whilst also considering how individual performance and competence can be assured with appropriate selection and development of staff.
There is particular emphasis on understanding crowd behaviour while how systems impact upon performance, health and wellbeing are also considered.
On successful completion of the module, you will be able to:
Demonstrate a deep understanding of ergonomics / human factors approaches to the analysis of problems and the design of effective systems
Critically analyse systems to identify where ergonomics may benefit overall system functioning and appreciate the impact any ergonomics / human factors interventions may have upon wider system functioning
Critically analyse an event, such as a major disaster, from an ergonomics / human factors perspective, and recognise the role that ergonomics / human factors can play in the analysis of, and potential prevention of, such events
This is a CIEHF Accredited Training Course.

Careers
This course can support people who particularly want to gain knowledge about Systems Theory and application of this to Ergonomics problems. This is likely to be relevant to those who already have some knowledge of one or more of the areas of Ergonomics (for example, psychology, physiology or engineering/design) and want to enhance them with this specific discipline.
The System Ergonomics Certificate of Credit course focuses on you obtaining 20 credits at level seven for your CPD.
The Chartered Institute of Ergonomics and Human Factors (CIEHF)
is an excellent resource for employment opportunities and for information about gaining experience in ergonomics.
