Course description
The distinctive nature of this programme is represented by the flexibility of its design and delivery. Its construction and innovative modes of delivery recognise the diverse and dispersed nature of not only the industry itself, but the potential student body it will serve. Due to the geographical spread of the industry, manufacturing sites and offices are often remote and isolated. Technical and operational staff very often spend a significant proportion of their time working outdoors, can be transient (with seasonal working activities sometimes playing a part) and they may also find that they are suddenly re-located, in some cases abroad. The provision offered within this programme of study, has had to evolve to meet the needs of such learners: taking advantage not only of traditional teaching and learning techniques, but utilising the most advanced learning technology for teaching, learning, supervision and assessment.
Key Characteristics
The programme is designed to enable agile delivery of the teaching and learning activities. The programme delivery model comprises a blended distance learning model, which allows on-line learning material to be supported by face-to-face sessions
Delivery of face-to-face teaching is undertaken at the Enterprise Centre which provides a more corporate environment

Engineering & Mathematics
The principles of mathematics, and mechanical and electrical engineering are fundamental to the operation of production, processing and mobile plant. This module aims to develop an understanding of the principles and concepts of basic mechanics and to introduce the basic theories and concepts of electricity, electrical circuits, electrical measurement, magnetism and electromagnetic induction. Furthermore, the module aims to develop a wider understanding of the use of mathematical principles and techniques and apply them to applications in the fields of engineering and mineral products technology.
Industry Introduction
This module provides the learner with an underpinning knowledge and understanding of the Mineral Products Industry. The module will introduce the learner to the economic importance of the industry, its role in modern economies, and how it underpins the very fabric of civilisation. It will explore its roots in geosciences, providing an understanding of the chemistry and geology of the planet and its application in the evolution and exploitation of the minerals its mines. It explores the widespread nature of the industry across the United Kingdom and globally. Fundamental to working in this industry, particularly in the operational areas, is an understanding and competence in the recognition and application of health, safety, and environmental awareness. Furthermore, the leaner will gain knowledge of emergency planning procedures and the safe use and guarding of machinery and equipment used within the mineral products sector. Finally, learners will be introduced to both first aid in the context of the work environment and also mental health to keep pace with industry guidelines and best practice.
Industry & the Environment
Central to this module is the development of knowledge in the field of geology that is beneficial to the safe and effective operation of mineral extraction and construction sites and the identification of geological hazards. This module also introduces the general concepts of workplace health and safety with particular attention to noise and hazardous substances. A further element to this module is the introduction of sustainability and in particular corporate, social responsibility, standards, and governance in the context of the mineral products industry. Key topics are discussed and developed including climate change, net zero and performance reporting. Furthermore, the impact of biodiversity, geodiversity and natural capital as applied to the mineral products industry are described and discussed.
Learning, Thinking & Study Skills in Higher Education
This module gives learners the opportunity to identify and reflect on their own strengths and weaknesses, to enable personal developmental planning needs, to be identified as they begin to progress through their learning journey within the Mineral Products industry. It provides learners with the basic knowledge and tools required to recognise and review their personal learning and thinking skills. It explores with them how they can identify and assess their developmental progress and equips them with the skills needed for academic study, writing and progression. It will provide examples of how they can use this knowledge and the associated tools within the context of their workplace in the Mineral Products industry. This module will also provide learners with an introduction to British Values, PREVENT and Safeguarding followed by leadership, which will supplement their developmental and employability potential within the work context. In addition, specifically for apprenticeship learners this module will introduce the Knowledge and Skills required to prepare and develop an e-portfolio required for End Point Assessment purposes
Year Two
Engineering Principles & Theory
The engineering concept within the mineral products sector is fundamental to the successful operation of static and mobile plant. This module will develop an understanding of the theory and principles of mechanics and their application within the sector. The principles and concepts associated with heat and fuels and their application in burners are introduced and awareness of engineering materials and of the fundamental principles of corrosion in relation to beams and fixed structures is developed. Furthermore, this module will focus on an understanding of the principles and concepts associated with the use of AC electricity and its application within the sector before extending the students understanding of electrical power transmission systems, electric motors and generators.
Construction Products Technology
Mineral resources form the basis of most products used in construction. This module develops knowledge of the technology, EN standards, specifications and other requirements that apply to these products. It will include aspects such as the methods used to sample and test aggregates, bituminous mixtures, cement and concrete, and bricks in a safe manner. In addition, the module will develop knowledge of the technology, characteristics and Standards used in customer specifications for these products. The module also provides knowledge of the techniques used to manage product quality to satisfy the needs of the customer.
Business & Operational Management
This module develops the operational, business and financial knowledge and skills necessary to achieve the effective management of a mineral products facility. This includes an understanding of the human implications of running a successful business. The module also recognises the importance of communication (written and none written skills), people and values in developing a positive workplace culture. Furthermore, the concepts and principles of asset management are introduced to develop skills in relation to performance measurement and monitoring. To meet with modern day challenges students are also provided with the fundamentals of building a sustainable business and the concept of cyber security.

The student will also develop an understanding of the methods used to investigate and analyse the causes and extent of deterioration in a concrete structure. This will be supplemented by knowledge of the methods used to repair and protect reinforced and pre-stressed concrete.
Mineral Products Workbased Project
This module brings together the learner’s knowledge of the industry gained from the programme and asks them to offer a detailed discussion of a problematic area and locate it within the wider context of current academic and professional thinking as presented in the literature and within the context of the area of the Mineral Product industry in which they work. Learners will be expected to demonstrate the ability to diagnose an organisational issue, to present this issue in a coherent manner, and to draw conclusions from their reading, personal analysis and workplace experience.
How you will learn
The programme is influenced by the principles of work-based learning. As such a flexible range of teaching and learning methodologies are used relevant to particular groups or practices. For example:
Face to face taught modules combining tutor input with structured opportunities for discussion, reflection and planning for workplace application
Learning opportunities identified and taken directly from the learner’s workplace situation
Action learning sets and other facilitated group activities
Individual reflection on learning
Technology enhanced learning using a sophisticated virtual learning environment (VLE).
At undergraduate level, the emphasis is on fostering independent learning, whilst providing a supporting environment in which to study at higher level. One of the key aims of any undergraduate programme is to produce an independent learner capable of properly managing their time and resources to identify issues, decide how to collect and analyse evidence and reach reasoned evidence based conclusions, and to subsequently present this information via various methods of communication (written and oral).
Indicative methods of assessment include activities such as:
practical projects focused on particular workplaces
management and technical reports
annotated presentations
reflective portfolios or collections of work completed throughout the module / programme
E-assessments via the Virtual Learning Environment
problem solving tasks
varied writing tasks and oral assessment
practical assessment of professional competence
These indicative approaches will be used to test attainment of knowledge and understanding as well as skills and capabilities thereby promoting ‘deep learning’.
