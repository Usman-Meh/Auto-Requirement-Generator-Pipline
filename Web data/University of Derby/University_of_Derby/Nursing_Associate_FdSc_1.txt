What is a nursing associate?
Nursing associate is a relatively new role, which bridges the gap between health and care assistants and registered nurses. Nursing associates work in many health and social care settings, from hospitals to care homes, hospices, GP practices and community services.
Responsibilities vary depending on the care setting you work in, but your duties are likely to include:
performing and recording clinical observations such as blood pressure, temperature, respirations and pulse
undertaking clinical tasks including venepuncture and ECGs
supporting people when they are faced with unwelcome news and life-changing diagnoses
discussing and sharing information with other professionals on a patients’ condition, behaviour, activity and assessments
ensuring the privacy, dignity and safety of individuals is maintained at all times
recognising issues to do with safeguarding vulnerable children and adults
Key benefits of this course
Learn about all four fields of nursing so you can find out where your passions and talents lie
Get the qualification you need to become a Registered Nursing Associate (a title protected by law) and/or use this course as a step towards becoming a Registered Nurse
Study in Derby or Chesterfield
Spend 50% of your time on placement and 50% of your time at university
This is a well-established course. In fact, we were one of the first institutions to run a nursing associate programme
Is this course for me?
This is a two-year course that requires you to study full-time. If you would prefer to train while you are working, you could look for a Nursing Associate Apprenticeship with an employer, and then follow our equivalent
apprenticeship programme
.
People usually take this course for one of the following reasons:
They want to become a Registered Nursing Associate
They want to become a Registered Nurse but don’t yet have the qualifications to get onto one of the full
nursing degrees
They want to become a Registered Nurse but don’t yet know which area to specialise in, so they want to experience all four areas of nursing first
These are all good reasons to take this course! After completing this foundation degree, you could join one of our full nursing degrees in year two and complete that within 18 months.

First-class facilities
Our Derby campus and Chesterfield site both offer outstanding learning environments. They include replica wards, treatment rooms, and a state-of-the-art Immersive Suite, which simulates the sights and sounds of different care settings - such as the inside of an ambulance, a busy A&E ward, or an operating theatre. It’s as close to the real thing as you can get, and will help prepare you for placements. You will use these facilities periodically throughout year one and two.
In tune with latest developments
This course is closely mapped against the needs of employers. In delivering the programme we respond to national changes, such as latest government policies, to ensure your learning is up-to-date and relevant.
As health care is increasingly delivered by multi-professional teams, we offer opportunities at each stage of the course for you to learn with, and from, students from other disciplines. This is really important in preparing you to work in more flexible ways after graduation. By learning to work together, you can help achieve the best outcomes for your patients.
Higher Technical Qualification
This programme has been recognised as a
Higher Technical Qualification
, which means it has been developed by awarding bodies in collaboration with employers, so you'll get the right training, knowledge, and skills to succeed in the workplace.

How you will learn
Placements
At least 50% of your time will be spent on placement in both years. This is so you can build up the clinical skills required to meet the
Nursing and Midwifery Council Standards of Proficiency for Nursing Associates
. Placements happen throughout the course, so that you alternate between learning the theory at university and then gaining experience on placement.
We aim to provide a variety of placements. For instance, you could be placed in hospitals, GP practices, care/nursing homes, or with community-based teams, such as school nurses or mental health crisis teams. You will have a Practice Assessor and Supervisor on each placement who will provide guidance, support, and valuable feedback.
Please be aware that you are expected to travel up to 90 minutes each way to get to a placement, and to work the shift hours set by that organisation.
Other study
During your time at university, you will learn through lectures, scenario-based learning sessions, tutorials, seminars, debates, and practice-based workshops. You will be asked to consider different cases and say what you would do, share your own experiences, and listen and learn from other trainees.
How you are assessed
Assessment approaches are varied and include poster presentations, exam, essays, assignments, case based discussions and practical skills assessments.
Who you will meet
Our teaching team includes experts in all four areas of nursing. All are qualified health professionals, with years of experience in nursing and leadership roles within health and social care. They have strong links with the local NHS trusts as well as with smaller health and social care providers, and this will really benefit you when it comes to finding placements.
"I found the staff were very supportive and wanted everyone to thrive. I really feel like the staff took a great person-centred approach with students.” Emma Macukiewicz, Nursing Associate student

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
