Tailor your degree to suit your needs and aspirations, with the choice of a wide range of optional modules.
The world needs writers and publishers
The UK market for written information and creative content of all types is of enormous significance to cultural and political life, as well as to economic growth. However, we live in a fast-changing society where consumers are bombarded with fake news and a flood of information daily. This means that carefully curated and diverse content is more important than ever.
The publishing industry is rapidly adapting to this evolving digital marketplace. It is a resilient, creative and global industry that continues to grow year-on-year. To do so, it relies on professionals who are commercially and digitally aware, and who feel passionate about books, writing and reading. Could that be you?
We blend the creative and the commercial
In today's publishing industry, authors, editors, literary agents and other professionals need to collaborate with each other to an unprecedented degree. If they have an understanding of each other’s roles and priorities, they can do this well. That’s why this course looks at the industry from both the perspective of the writer and the perspective of the publishing professional.
This gives you a distinct advantage in the workplace; if you want to be a writer, we’ll ensure you  understand the marketplace for your work and the practicalities of getting it published, including self-publishing or working with literary agents. Equally, if you're an aspiring publishing professional, we’ll give you valuable insight into the creative processes, aspirations and concerns of authors, alongside the communications skills that are vital for any publishing role.
"I have been grateful to have dynamic lecturers who are supportive and knowledgeable about all aspects related to this creative industry. They make the learning process accessible and engaging. The lecturers have always challenged me to produce my best work and allowed me to develop a wide range of skills which will be invaluable in my career after graduation. The programme provides a range of modules which will open many different opportunities for me."
Fred Gough, Writing and Publishing Student

Our tutors themselves are experienced writers and publishing professionals, with a network of industry connections.
Practical and applied
This course includes writing workshops and work-based projects with employers, to help you hone and apply your skills. You might be producing magazines and anthologies of student work, creating interactive eBooks, or crafting industry-standard TV and film scripts. By the end of your studies, you will have a portfolio of professionally developed and presented work to show to a potential employer.
We also encourage you gain as much experience of  the industry as you can. You can use our networks across the creative and cultural sector to find opportunities for mentoring, internships, placements and volunteering.
We take part in NaNoWriMo — a programme for young writers, which offers great tools, resources and access to a supportive community.
"Studying Writing and Publishing at Derby is a decision I will never regret. The lecturers are fantastic people, supportive and encouraging; our discussions in class were simulating and insightful. I particularly enjoyed utilising the book production, commissioning, and editorial skills I had gained while on the course, to self-publish two eBooks as part of my major publishing project."

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
