Foundation Year - helping you to achieve more
Including a foundation year as part of your four-year study programme will give you a head start in your academic and professional life. The foundation year offers the chance to strengthen your skills, knowledge and confidence – with extensive support from our expert staff – before you advance to stage one of your honours degree. It could also be beneficial if you are planning a career change and want to get to grips with aspects of subjects which are new to you.
Our degrees with a foundation year are continuous, meaning that you won’t need to apply again once you have successfully completed the first year.

Understanding the challenges
A recent example included a visit by our final year Business, Accounting and Finance Students to Bolsover District Council to learn about the association and importance of their work. Students spent the day exploring the departments forming the government-based organisation and the stakeholder challenges faced whilst decision-making.  The trip provided insight on the leadership style and organisations environment, duties and challenges; it was a great opportunity for the students to experience the work that Bolsover District Council do for the community. Following the trip, students explained how interesting it was to explore the government sector and other public services in detail.  One student stated that the trip has inspired them to work in the public sector to help the community.
Forward thinking

For the rest of your degree a range of assessment methods are used. In the first stage we use a range of computer-based assessments to help you gauge your own level of learning. These assessments give you feedback on how you do so that it helps your learning in a constructive way. In other modules there are essays and reports to submit. At the second and third stages you will be assessed mainly by examinations, but also by essays, business reports, projects and presentations.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
