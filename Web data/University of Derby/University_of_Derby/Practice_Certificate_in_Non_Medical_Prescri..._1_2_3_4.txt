Module description
About this module
This module enables Podiatrists to develop the necessary skills and knowledge to practice as independent prescribers, and to meet the standards set by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC).
This course is for practitioners who are registered as a podiatrist and in good standing with the Health Care Professions Council. Applicants must be working at an advanced practice level with appropriate post-registration patient-orientated experience, in a relevant practice setting and an identified area in which to develop independent prescribing practice.
Prescribing by a range of professionals has developed over a number of years, enabling improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of health care provision. The post-graduate practice certificates in non-medical prescribing have been developed to meet the growing demand for prescribing courses nationally and locally. The course is one core 40 credit module studied over two semesters that enables practitioners to work autonomously when making clinical decisions for the people in their care, with an awareness of personal limitations within their expanding scope of professional competence. This inter-professional programme enables learners to develop their knowledge and skills to become qualified Non-Medical Prescribers (NMP) (also known as Independent / Supplementary prescribers) as recognised by their professional regulatory body.
