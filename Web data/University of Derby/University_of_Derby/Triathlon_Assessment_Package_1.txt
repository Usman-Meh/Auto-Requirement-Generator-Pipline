Learning outcomes
What's involved?
This package includes the following battery of tests:
Body composition assessment
Cycling Assessment
Resting blood analysis – Haematocrit & Haemoglobin
Assessment of cycling efficiency (We calculate your gross efficiency and FatMax using advanced gas analysis, this is vital when it comes to calculating fuel use for longer events)
Measures of critical power (a more accurate FTP) and anaerobic work capacity (the battery of energy above critical power)
Rest
Running Assessment
Running Economy
Running economy is a key aspect of longer duration endurance performance. Economy is the VO2 required to run at sub-maximal speeds. It will be measured as part of the 3 minute step test described below
Blood lactate and gas analysis
A 3 minute step test will be completed on the treadmill. Running velocity will be increased from low velocity at 3 minute intervals until your reach thresholds in the lactate profile. Capillary blood samples will be measured after each stage to identify LT1 and LT2. Once we have identified clear threshold in the lactate profile the protocol will change to a ramp protocol where running velocity is gradually increased until you reach exhaustion
