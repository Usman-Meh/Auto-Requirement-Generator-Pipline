Foundation Year - helping you to achieve more
Including a foundation year as part of your four-year study programme will give you a head start in your academic and professional life. The foundation year offers the chance to strengthen your skills, knowledge and confidence – with extensive support from our expert staff – before you advance to stage one of your honours degree. It could also be beneficial if you are planning a career change and want to get to grips with aspects of subjects which are new to you.
Our degrees with a foundation year are continuous, meaning that you won’t need to apply again once you have successfully completed the first year.
Managing Excellence
When Mark Faghy first arrived in Derby as a teenage undergraduate, he stated proudly that his goal was to become manager of the England football team. Now he is a respected research academic leading an international collaboration in the fight against Covid. And his students are helping.

Join a new generation of sport specialists
Our course is specially designed to meet a growing demand for strength and conditioning specialists who are also skilled in injury rehabilitation and risk reduction. It has been launched at a time when greater collaboration is needed between sport science experts and medical or injury management teams.
We introduce you to the most up-to-date practices, techniques and applications so that you are fully prepared for a range of career roles in the sports industry.
See the professionals in action
We’re committed to delivering a first class student experience, so we draw extensively on our thriving partnerships with sports organisations such as Derby County FC, Leicester City FC, Burton Albion FC, Leicester Tigers Rugby Club, Derbyshire County Cricket Club, Derventio Swimming Club and the Derbyshire Institute of Sport.
There are opportunities to go on fascinating visits to see the professionals in action. One example was a trip to Perform at St George’s Park where students learned how hydrotherapy can be used to aid athlete rehabilitation and recovery.
Our collaborations also pave the way to rewarding work placement opportunities. You could begin by observing and shadowing professionals working in the strength, conditioning and rehabilitation arena, then advancing to a more hands-on role as your experience and confidence grows. One Derby student, for instance, secured a Strength and Conditioning Internship at Sheffield United FC.
Cutting-edge resources
A bespoke  is among the many state-of-the-art facilities in our new £10.8m . It incorporates a VICON 3D motion capture system and integrated Kistler Force Plates. Here you can build your practical and coaching skills in weightlifting, prehabilitation and metabolic conditioning while also becoming familiar with session planning and delivery.
You’ll also discover up-to-the-minute equipment for testing and measuring the parameters of health and fitness in our sport and exercise facilities and our biomechanics laboratory. We introduce you to a broad range of computer software packages for statistical and movement analysis too.
Throughout your studies you can make full use of all the facilities at our award-winning Sports Centre, which boasts a main hall, fitness gym, studios, squash and badminton courts, an internal climbing wall, sprint track, changing rooms, treatment rooms and a café.
High-quality, relevant teaching
Actively involved in research, high-performance sport and applied sport science consultancy, our staff will give you all the expert support you need to fulfil your ambitions. They are accredited professionals who belong to leading bodies such as the United Kingdom Strength and Conditioning Association and the Society of Sports Therapists.
You will also hear from established sports practitioners who deliver masterclasses offering vital pointers to foster your employability skills and maximise your chances in the graduate job market.
Our Performance Suite
Our Performance Suite allows Sport and Exercise Science students to learn about performance analysis, biomechanics, strength and conditioning, and injury prevention. As well as elite athletes outside of the University, you'll also be working with our Team Derby athletes to help them improve their performance and successfully compete. Take a look at the Performance Suite and Vicon cameras in action:

If you enjoy a challenge and would like to make the most of your own sporting passion and prowess, you could become involved with
Team Derby
which is the focal point for the University’s sporting community. It encompasses all aspects of sport, including courses, numerous sports clubs, the Athletics Union and sport development activities. You can also take part in the national
BUCS (British Universities and Colleges Sport)

We have also recently appointed Double Olympic Medallist, Bryan Steel, as the Head Coach for Team Derby Performance Sport Cycling. Bryan is a celebrated figure in the world of cycling, bringing a wealth of experience to his role. The decorated Olympian, who represented Team GB at four Olympic Games from 1992 to 2004, boasts an impressive medal collection. His crowning achievements include a bronze medal in the team pursuit event at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and a silver medal at the 2004 Athens Games in the same discipline. Brian's journey also includes 14 World Championship appearances, where he secured five medals, along with three medals at the Commonwealth Games. With the arrival of Bryan, Performance Sport at the university will work in partnership with HUUB-BCC Race Team to give track and road riders access to an elite pathway during and post higher education. This collaboration opens doors for Team Derby Performance Cycling's athletes, offering a unique opportunity to bridge their academic pursuits with professional cycling aspirations.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
