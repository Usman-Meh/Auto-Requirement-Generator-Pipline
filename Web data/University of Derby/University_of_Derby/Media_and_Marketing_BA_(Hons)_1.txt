The media landscape is changing more rapidly than ever before, with new challenges and opportunities
,
raised by digital technologies, making the media and communications sector one of the most exciting and dynamic environments for graduate work. The development of digital communications and distribution, the internet and social media have reshaped the way that we produce, market, distribute and consume media and information and will continue to do so. You’ll embrace and explore these landscapes, which will give you the chance to develop the knowledge and skills for a graduate career in the media and marketing field.
A particular emphasis throughout this course is on writing and creativity for different media forms. You will learn the different strategies and conventions of narrative script and treatment writing, documentary, blogging, journalism and public relations, marketing and advertising. These practices are supported and enhanced with skills in the production of web video, basic website production and social media use, all designed to enable you to understand, create and manage communications projects in the new digital cultural economies.
Build your confidence with hands-on experience
Real-world learning is a key feature of the course and you will have the opportunity to work with local and national organisations and employers, engaging in projects such as public relations and promotional campaigns and media and marketing research. You will learn how to write for different media platforms, such as journalism, promotional and PR writing, with an emphasis on digital media platforms such as web content writing, blogging and social media. You could also develop your creativity through the planning or design of media and marketing projects such as film and television documentary or advertising, learning essential skills in script or treatment writing, digital video and editing.
Employers recognise that employability derives not just from applied and practical experience but also from the transferable critical, analytical, research and communication skills. This is fostered by academic study from the personal curiosity, enthusiasm for knowledge, confident problem solving and critical thinking that drives interdisciplinary subjects such as media and marketing. Helping you develop these skills is at the heart of the course where you will be taught by an enthusiastic team of experienced academics and practitioners with industry links and experience. Our creative and innovative range of teaching and assessments, personal and careers support and opportunities such as employability events, industry guest speakers and work experience opportunities will help you gain the most from your studies and understand how your learning will prepare you for a graduate career.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
