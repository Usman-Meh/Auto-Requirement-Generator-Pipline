Develop your creative and performance skills with a course underpinned by investigation into the aesthetic, analytical, sociological and historical dimensions of music. Pair this with an entrepreneurship curriculum that is leading-edge, vocationally relevant, challenging and reflects the complex nature of contemporary business.
We’ll help to prepare you for a career in a global business environment that is rapidly changing, and you’ll be supported to become more agile, innovative and resilient. You’ll also develop self-learning and team-working skills, both crucial to success in the professional sphere.
Gold standard facilities
You’ll discover a superb range of music making facilities at our Markeaton Street site, including state-of-the-art recording studios, rehearsal space, music technology labs and three post-production rooms equipped with the latest software. The facilities you’ll learn in match the specifications of professional studios in the UK and overseas.
We offer a wide range of instruments, amplifiers and outboard gear on which you can develop your skills, together with a classic 48 channel Neve recording console.
We’re one of the leading universities conducting research into surround-sound technologies and all our control rooms accommodate 5.1 speaker arrays. We also have a surround-sound research lab which has a 40-speaker ambisonics surround speaker array allowing height and depth parameters.
Our new Business School will be opening in 2024/25 and is set to be a focal point for Derby’s business community. You’ll study alongside start-ups and small businesses, giving you the opportunity to network, learn from and inspire local business leaders and entrepreneurs.

Our Music courses are accredited by the Joint Audio Media Education Support (JAMES), the professional music industry accreditation body, so you can be confident that they meet the high standards demanded by industry.
JAMES accredited courses
Our Music courses are accredited by the Joint Audio Media Education Support (JAMES), the professional music industry accreditation body, so you can be confident that they meet the high standards demanded by industry.
Head of Music and Performing Arts, John Crossley, explains what this means for students: "The re-accreditation for our music programmes continues our long standing relationship with JAMES and the Music Producers Guild (MPG). The assessors were very impressed with our facilities, our committed teaching team and how we have dealt with the challenging circumstances of a global pandemic. This stamp of approval from professional producers in the industry means that our students can be confident not only with the quality of the programmes of study but also the opportunities and support they receive as they follow their exciting careers."
Choose your pathway
Studying a Popular Music and Entrepreneurship Joint Honours degree allows you to choose whether you major in Popular Music or study them both equally.
You begin this degree by studying both subjects equally in your first year. By the end of your first year, you will then decide whether you would like to major in Popular Music or continue to study them both equally.

BA (Hons) Popular Music with Entrepreneurship

How you will learn
Your Popular Music modules will be taught through a range of methods including:
lectures
composition
tutorials and practical workshops
group discussion
On your Entrepreneurship modules you will learn through methods such as:
formal lectures which will at times include expert speakers
Seminars which can be tutor-led or student-led and can include discussions, critical analysis of reading, presentations, group work, debates and general problem solving, interaction with real businesses, case study analysis, computer lab work, practical analysis and formative assessment
tutorials which are one-to-one sessions with a tutor to discuss the development of assignments
work experience projects
self-directed study
How you are assessed
For Popular Music modules, you’ll be assessed by either coursework only or a combination of coursework, portfolios, assignments, case studies, oral and graphic presentations, collaborative and interdisciplinary teamwork projects, computer testing and examinations, so providing a flexible and effective means of assessing your progress.
For Entrepreneurship modules, we mostly assess you through practical coursework assignments — the sort of tasks you might undertake in a workplace. Sometimes these will be individual tasks and at other times, you will need to work in a group.
Assignments could include:
business reports
research and consultancy projects
presentations
design of digital materials such as videos, blogs or augmented reality posters and computer-based assessments

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
