The Ergonomics and Human Factors (Healthcare) Certificate of Credit course looks at how ergonomics / human factors perspectives can make an impact and add value within healthcare. During the course, we look at the importance of illness cognitions and health behaviours together with the role of health promotion and the successful management of long-term conditions.
We consider medical device usability, medical errors, and the communication of information within healthcare and explore the potential impact of 'the internet of medical things' on changes to the way we monitor individuals and provide appropriate care.
The course also covers the issue of adherence to clinical regimes and the importance of patient-professional communication in developing effective partnerships. A key theme underpinning this course is the recognition of the need to move away from biomedical approaches and adopt biopsychosocial views on health and wellbeing.
This course is an optional module within our
online MSc Ergonomics and Human Factors programme
and can be completed as a standalone 10-week course. You will gain 20 credits at level 7 with a Certificate of Credit to evidence your learning achievement.
On successful completion of the course, you will be able to:
Critically evaluate the extent to which psychological theory aids our understanding of the relationship between human behaviour and health
Have a deep understanding of how ergonomics/human factors can contribute towards patient safety
Critically evaluate how the importance of ergonomics / human factors issues can be communicated and disseminated to various stakeholders
This is a CIEHF Accredited Training Course.
