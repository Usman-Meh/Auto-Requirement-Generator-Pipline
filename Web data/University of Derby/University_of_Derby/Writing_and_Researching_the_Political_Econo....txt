Online course description
Writing and Researching the Political Economy of Inequality is a free online course that seeks to deepen your engagement with a range of debates on global and domestic inequalities, which present the key challenges of our time.
The course is ideal for postgraduate students and early career researchers with some grounding in (International) Political Economy and/or related disciplines. It will help to develop both conceptual and practical research skills and build confidence and familiarity in a range of data collection methods.
The course begins with a definitional unit which asks you to think about the different ways in which inequalities are defined and measured. It then precedes to outline an analytical framework that can help to draw together research on different forms of inequality in different temporal, spatial and social contexts. The course then moves through several units which help you to understand the research process; starting with setting effective research questions, moving through the location of research in existing knowledge and then progressing to a variety of data collection techniques. The course culminates with support and guidance on how to make the most of communicating research findings to a variety of audiences, ranging from other researchers interested in your topic, to policymakers and practitioners, and a wider interested public.
As you progress through the course, you will be able to use the materials to support the development of you own research project on the political economy of inequalities. Self-guided tasks and assessments allow you to check your progress and gain confidence in the progression of your research. The aim is to support both postgraduate students and early career researchers to develop their own capacity for research and their academic and research careers.
Who is this course for?
Though this course is open to anyone interested in the topic, it has been created for postgraduate students and early career researchers specifically interested in the political economy of inequality.

Course units
Unit 1 - Defining and Measuring Inequality
This unit explores how inequality is defined, understood and measured. It identifies some contemporary patterns in inequality including areas that are rarely discussed and asks you to critically reflect on your research plans, identifying how you define and measure inequality in your own work.
Unit 2 - Researching Inequality Through Time, Space and Scale
This unit explores how we can identify patterns of inequality from varying temporal, spatial and scalar perspectives, helping you to reflect on how you utilise time, space and scale in your own research.
Unit 3 - Setting Research Questions and Reviewing Literature
In this unit we ask you to reflect on the sources of your research interests, how these can be developed into a statement of aims, objectives and research questions that frame your work.
Unit 4 - Locating your Research in Existing Knowledge
This unit will help you to perform and track literature searches conducted via Google Scholar, to be able to identify the differences between types of literature reviews and select a literature review type that is most appropriate for your own research.
Unit 5 - Research Methods I: Qualitative Data Collection
This unit takes you through the process of qualitative data collection. It will help you to identify potential interviewees and create a topic guide for one-to-one or group interviews for use in your research project. You will create a risk register for use when applying observational data collection techniques and identify strengths and weaknesses of qualitative data collection techniques.
Unit 6 - Research Methods II: Quantitative Data Collection
This unit looks at how to use quantitative data on inequality in your research, helping you to identify and select appropriate secondary data sources. You will explore how to design a questionnaire to gather quantitative data for your research project.
Unit 7 - Research Dissemination and Impact
This final unit will help you disseminate the results of your research by looking at how to write for a variety of different audiences and exploring different dissemination methods for reaching the target audience for your research. You will also prepare a plan to develop your research impact.
Learning outcomes
This course supports the development of your research focus as well as your growth as a researcher. The course seeks to:
Explore some of the conceptual and theoretical foundations to the study of the political economy of inequality
Support the development of research projects and of new knowledge about the political economy of inequality
Support the development of research careers focused on the political economy of inequality
Generate change through the production of new knowledge about the political economy of inequality
