Strong financial management is essential to a prosperous business. By combining management know-how with financial expertise, you’ll be ideally placed to deliver practical business solutions that ensure any organisation fulfils its potential.
By the time you graduate from the BA (Hons) Business Management and Finance, you’ll be taking financial analysis and projections in your stride. You’ll have the specialist skills to assess the financial health of an organisation, control and co-ordinate its financial resources effectively, and help it avoid common pitfalls in performance management. You’ll also have a strong understanding of corporate governance.
Accreditation
We have developed this course in close consultation with the premier professional body for managers, the Chartered Management Institute (CMI). It is one of the few degrees in the country where you can graduate with the CMI Level 5 Diploma in Management and Leadership alongside your degree.
The Diploma is the benchmark qualification for full CMI membership and takes you a step towards Chartered Manager status, signalling to prospective employers that you’re suited for senior leadership roles and rapid promotion. You won’t need to take extra exams or coursework to achieve the Diploma: our combined module and CMI assessments offer a smooth route to both qualifications.
Throughout the degree, you will become an affiliate member of the CMI, at no extra cost, with access to networking events, online resources and additional benefits to support your career development and enhance your employability.
If you aspire to a career with a financial focus, the course also features optional modules offering exemptions from the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) papers. It gives you a head start if you would like to qualify as a chartered management accountant eventually.
Boost your employability with a placement year
You’ll have the opportunity to take a placement year to put the skills you’ve learned into practice in a real-world environment. We'll support you to find your placement and throughout your year in industry. Placements allow you to gain valuable experience to add to your CV, make industry contacts and help you to narrow down what kind of role you may be interested in after graduation.
Charlotte Evans: falling in love
Charlotte Evans came to university with a completely pragmatic approach to learning. Then she found a gap in her knowledge. And she started exploring it. And now she is completely and utterly in love. With finance.

Professional mentoring
Thanks to the CMI accreditation, we can introduce you to a privileged network of contacts. You’ll have the opportunity to be supported by a CMI mentor at every stage of your degree.
Your mentor will be a senior business person, either a Chartered Manager or Fellow of the CMI, with a wealth of experience and insights to share with you. From day one, they will advise and coach you from a business perspective, showing how the management and financial theory you are learning can be applied directly to the workplace.
Hands-on learning
You’ll take the theories off the page and put them into practice in real-world scenarios. You can test your ideas through business simulations, topical case studies and employer-led projects. A live consultancy project, where you help an employer to improve business performance, will build your financial analysis, research, project management, problem-solving and decision-making skills.
You could also benefit from fieldtrips to see business in close-up: one recent example was to the Sony UK Technology Centre, the company’s manufacturing and customer service base in Wales.
Facilities and resources
To bring your financial studies into sharp focus, we offer direct use of
Bloomberg
data, information and analytics. Our
Financial Markets Lab
is a dedicated trading room providing a simulation of what it’s like to work on a real trading floor in the financial district. You’ll get to grips with the same information and technology used by financial professionals across the world, ensuring you can make a contribution from day one in your career.
Global thinking
Your learning will be enriched by international perspectives. Ours is a global student community and the BA (Hons) Business Management and Finance not only attracts students from all over the world to Derby but is also delivered for our educational partners across Europe and Asia. It means there is a lot of potential for inter-country debates, seminars and guest lectures delivered online, international case studies and joint projects.
In your second year, you’ll have the option to spend an exchange week in Barcelona studying at the EU Business School, one of our academic partners which runs the same degree and where teaching is in English. You could also take advantage of other optional visits overseas: a trip to Copenhagen saw our students investigating issues such as art fraud.
Expert teaching
You’ll be taught by an experienced and highly qualified team with an impressive track record for research and a national reputation for excellence. The team has extensive contacts in the business and professional community regionally, nationally and internationally – and you can draw on those connections for inspiration and insight.
New Derby Business School in the city centre
We're building a new Derby Business School, serving as an international centre of excellence. The superb new teaching facilities will build on our established reputation for inspirational teaching and research excellence, as we shape the next generation of qualified business leaders.

How you will learn
Our ‘scaffolded’ approach to learning provides a smooth transition so that you can ease your way into both university-level study and business management practice. It means that you’ll have full support in the early stages of the degree but will gradually move towards greater independence as your knowledge deepens and you start to immerse yourself in the wider business community. By stage three, you will be able to take greater charge of your own learning, with module tutors advising and directing your studies.
Thanks to your contact with personal tutors, engagement with CMI mentors and participation in University events, you’ll become more attuned to professional behaviour and build your skills in critical thinking, creativity and self-reliance.
Another of our priorities is to foster a new generation of responsible business leaders with a strong moral compass. Throughout the course, you will therefore look at the role of business in wider society, exploring issues ranging from environmental sustainability to child labour, ethical governance to responsible innovation.
You’ll learn through different methods including:
formal lectures, sometimes involving guest speakers
tutor-led and student-led seminars
one-to-one and small group tutorials
work experience projects
work-related learning
self-directed study
optional placement and internship opportunities
video discussions with overseas partner institutions
How you are assessed
Assessment is mainly via coursework which can take forms such as:
traditional essays and reports
group project work
research and consultancy projects
presentations
posters
design of digital materials
in-class tests
computer-based assessments

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
