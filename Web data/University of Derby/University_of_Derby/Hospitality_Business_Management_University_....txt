This online Hospitality Business Management University Diploma course has been designed for hospitality professionals currently working in operational or supervisory positions who aspire towards more senior management roles within the industry. The course is an important step towards an undergraduate degree if you have prior academic qualifications and are already working within the hospitality industry, and it can be completed within 12 months. During the course you’ll develop your analytical, digital literacy and communication skills which can be directly applied in the workplace.
This course will help you to build confidence and gain a deeper understanding of the hospitality sector and prepare you to progress to a higher level of study. It can also count towards your continued professional development (CPD).
After completing this course you may wish to continue onto our
BA (Hons) International Hospitality Business Management (Top-Up)
degree and achieve a recognised undergraduate degree.

With a choice of dates to start your online Hospitality Business Management University Diploma course (September, January or May) and interactive online learning materials, you've got the flexibility to study whenever and wherever is most convenient for you. The course modules still operate within a fixed trimester but you can choose to study during the day, evenings or at the weekend instead of having to attend fixed lectures.
How much time should I allow for studying?
You will study three 20 credit modules over a 12 month period, each of which will be the equivalent of around 200 learning hours. Each module runs over 10 weeks and as a guide we recommend you allocate 20 hours per week, per module.
You’re in control
Studying online gives you the flexibility to study at the most convenient time and place for you. Course modules still operate within a fixed trimester but you can choose to study during the day, in the evenings or at the weekend rather than having to attend fixed lectures. This can be invaluable when you’re working in a busy hospitality role, because we know it’s not easy to get time off work. Throughout the course we’ll ask you to test out what you’re learning in your day-to-day role, and use your own experiences in assignments. Ultimately this should mean you find the course a useful step in your personal and professional career development.
