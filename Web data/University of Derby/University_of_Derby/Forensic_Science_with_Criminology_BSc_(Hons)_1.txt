Forensic Science with Criminology at Derby
You’ll combine high-level skills as a forensic scientist with specific knowledge of criminology. We explore questions surrounding the causes of criminal behaviour and whether nature or nurture is responsible for such characteristics. We also cover legal aspects of forensic science, including the court process, and the role played by expert testimony and evidence.
Our forensic science courses prepare you to become a highly skilled and confident professional, fully equipped to reach evidence-based conclusions and take a case from crime scene to courtroom. This course guides you through the full range of forensic practices and processes – from collecting and examining evidence to presenting your findings in court.
You’ll investigate mock crime scenes including break-ins, road accidents, assaults, and drug crime. This will help you prepare for the diverse scenarios that you are likely to encounter throughout your career.
Your studies will be underpinned by a strong focus on the criminal justice system and the legal aspects of forensic science. You’ll explore issues such as expert testimony and evidence, miscarriages of justice, the court process and the roles of the judge, jury and witnesses. You’ll also gain practice in delivering evidence in court and being cross-examined by barristers – just as you would in the world of work.
Expert teaching
You’ll benefit from the knowledge, experience and networks of our experienced teaching team which includes forensic scientists, criminology specialists, practising lawyers, barristers and judges.
Our active researchers conduct important studies into fields ranging from forensic handwriting analysis and fingerprint enhancement techniques to criminal investigations and witness reliability. High-profile visiting speakers also share their remarkable experiences with you.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
