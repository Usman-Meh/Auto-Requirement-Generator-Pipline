Module description
About this module
This module allows the student to experience the breadth of specialist public health service nursing provision. Reflective learning on practice, throughout the duration of the programme, provides opportunities to develop a deeper understanding and knowledge base about the wider implications of specialist public health practice.
It provides an opportunity for the student to produce a portfolio of evidential learning to meet the Nursing and Midwifery Council Standards of Proficiency, while working in a differing field of practice. This comprehensive portfolio of evidence demonstrates the skills and knowledge acquired through a critical lens. Combined with an ongoing action plan this module forms a firm foundation for the practitioners to meet their CPD requirements now and in the future.
