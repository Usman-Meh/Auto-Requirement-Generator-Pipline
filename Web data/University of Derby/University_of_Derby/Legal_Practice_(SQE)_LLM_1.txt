Our LLM in Legal Practice (SQE) is designed to support students through preparing to sit their external SQE qualifications. Alongside this, we aim to develop your commercial awareness through multi-faceted client scenarios so you can gain valuable skills ready to excel in contemporary professional practice.
You will learn in a supportive, flexible blended environment using an innovative mix of online lectures and activities, face-to-face workshops and independent study. Your face-to-face learning will be led by skilled practitioners and legal experts in the relevant areas of legal practice who bring their industry experience into the classroom to provide real-world insight into the topics you study. Your in-person learning will reinforce, contextualise and develop the knowledge and skills gained from your online activities to prepare you for the commercial realities of professional practice.
Prepare for your future career
A consideration of the ethical realities of commercial practice is also built into the learning to provide context of its place in society. These will be analysed in the context of both professional legal practice and in the context of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Through the integration of responsible practice, ensuring the integration of ethics, responsibility and sustainability in our teaching we aim to create responsible and aware practitioners. We aim to help you develop a sense of belonging and a sense of purpose from the outset, enabling you to take ownership of your own learning in a supportive environment.
An inclusive approach to learning
You will develop the skills and ability to evaluate the legal knowledge you gain through engagement with on-demand lectures and activities provided online by BARBRI, a leading provider of online professional legal education with extensive expertise in SQE 1 style exams.
Preparing you for your SQE exams
The SQE assessments themselves are separate to the LLM in Legal Practice (SQE) studied at the University of Derby and are run by an independent external provider. The cost of these assessments is not included in your tuition fees. To find out more SQE exam costs, please visit the

How you will learn
Your learning will be split into three stages throughout the course. In stage one your studies will encompass all elements of the Functioning Legal Knowledge (‘FLK’) 1 and 2 to achieve readiness to sit the external exams for SQE 1.
In the second stage of the course, you will cover the legal and professional skills necessary to succeed in the external SQE 2 assessments and practice at the level required of a competent newly qualified solicitor. These stages have been designed to try and align where possible to the SQE 1 and SQE 2 assessment dates.
The third stage of the course is the Independent Study element for the LLM in Legal Practice (SQE). This is the research part of the Master's degree, where you will have the opportunity to research in a specialist area of law and advanced areas of legal practice.
Throughout the three stages, you will learn through a combination of methods such as:
online lectures and activities provided by BARBRI
face to face teaching to contextualise your online learning
one on one formative opportunities
workshops.
You will be assessed through methods such as:
oral and written activities
simulated client case studies
an ongoing Learning Development Record
oral and written reflection on your learning
written assessment such as legal drafting
independent research.
Academic support
You’ll benefit from our academic staff in their role as learning coaches throughout your studies. Our teaching team offer programme specific support, recognising that students learn and develop their skills in different ways and some may benefit from further one to one or small group support.
Learning coaches will offer appointments for students to book onto in which you can:
discuss and reflect on their progress towards their readiness to sit SQE 1 and 2 in one-to-one environment
discuss how to improve and develop that progress in one-to-one environment
discuss issues of knowledge and understanding and ways of moving their understanding forward in
one-to-one environment
join small group sessions with further opportunity for subject guidance.
This will be in addition to the University of Derby’s Personal Academic Tutor system which provides the opportunity for you to meet with your designated academic member of staff to discuss your academic progress, your University experience and your professional aspirations.
