This programme is future-focused to ensure the quality of the educational experience of students now and for the future. It is, therefore, time for the existing PG Cert IPPE programme to be re-imagined and designed to support these sector-driven and organisational priorities.
This programme is for post-registration professionals employed across the Health and Social care landscape. The employees will be in roles that support HE learning, teaching and assessment across acute and community service provision. Many post-registration specialists and advanced practitioners will, once qualified, work autonomously. As such while they are training and preparing for their role, they require thorough support to facilitate a range of on-the-job learning opportunities and the advanced assessment of their potential for complex assessment, judgement and decision-making activity. This PG Cert LIPPE-APA programme aims to prepare all students with the knowledge, skills, values and behaviours required to reflexively facilitate such learning and development across the broad experiential range and academic scope of Health and Social Care provision.
It is primarily for those with less than two years of experience in teaching/supporting learning, or whose prior experience is no longer current (e.g., more than 5 years ago).
