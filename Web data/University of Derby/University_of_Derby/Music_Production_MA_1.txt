During this challenging course you'll develop the academic knowledge and practical skills you'll need to take advantage of current and future opportunities in the music and media production industry sectors.
Music and sound production are integral to the creative industries sector both in the UK and internationally and are at the forefront of a diverse range of commercial, educational and research developments. Representing a significant area of commercial innovation and creative practice, the growth of new media platforms provides exciting employment opportunities and requires up to date approaches to the development of appropriate professional expertise.
‌Professional judgement, technical and creative ability, and appropriate knowledge and understanding are key to success in the music and media sector. Increasingly characterised by sophisticated technical systems and close integration with a range of media, music production encompasses a number of distinct specialisms and provides a dynamic field of postgraduate research activity.
You will study both as an individual and as part of a group, to give you experience of working within multidimensional teams and managing leadership roles.
