A future-focused BSc
If you are an aspiring manager looking for a modern, online business degree that can fit around your existing commitments, this BSc would suit you. We welcome people from all walks of life and all professions, including those with experience rather than formal qualifications - we just need to be confident that you have what it takes to complete the course.
With a curriculum that has been recently refreshed, this BSc is future-focused and covers the latest trends and challenges affecting businesses across the globe. For instance, as well as core business management theory and practice, we will cover highly relevant topics such as:
agility, resilience, and leadership during the time of change
moral choices in management
creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship
marketing concepts and techniques, including the latest digital trends
responsible management, sustainable operations, and the circular economy
pursuing shared purpose while creating value for stakeholders, as well as for the wider society
Blending theory and practice
We encourage you to continuously apply the theory you learn on this course to real business environments, including your own, if you are working. We will look at real-life business case studies and scenarios, the latest research, and learn about the individual experiences of other students on the course. This will strengthen your understanding of the subjects and encourage you to consider situations and issues from different perspectives.
Global insights for global careers
As well as enabling you to learn from your new global network of fellow students, the course content itself encourages an international outlook. We’ll explore contemporary international business issues, and consider cultural, ethical, and professional practice across a range of international contexts.
This will enable you to work for businesses operating in a range of cultural and economic contexts, from small enterprises to large multinationals.
Two qualifications from one course
This online business and management degree is accredited by the Chartered Management Institute (CMI): a professional body in the UK dedicated to promoting the highest standards in management and leadership.
This accreditation provides a dual award, which means that alongside the BSc (Hons) Business and Management degree, you will also gain the CMI Level 5 Diploma in Management and Leadership or the CMI Level 5 Certificate when you graduate, as well as the BSc (Hons) Business and Management. This is subject to you passing the following modules*:
CMI Level 5 Diploma in Management and Leadership
CMI Level 5 Certificate
Leadership and Management (6BM502) (core module)
Project Management (5BM503) or Strategic Marketing (6MK522) (optional modules)
Independent Research Project (6BM997) (core module)
Leadership and Management (6BM502) (core module)
Independent Research Project (6BM997) (core module)
This combination of academic and professional qualifications will give you the advantage when looking for your next career move. It also enables you to access a range of
CMI membership benefits
.
Previous learning or experience
Have you already studied at another institution, completed a training course, or does your work experience appear equivalent to one or more modules of this course? If so, you may be able to translate this prior learning into credits towards your course modules, so you don’t have to study them again.
For this BSc, you can apply for credits of up to 50% for each stage. You can find out more in our
recognition of prior learning section
.
*Please note, only the modules studied on this course are counted towards the CMI accreditation. If you have been granted an exemption for any of the four modules listed as part of RPL (recognition of prior learning), you will not qualify for the CMI Diploma. Depending on the exemption, you may qualify for the CMI Level 5 Certificate.

How you will learn
This course is delivered entirely online, so you can study from anywhere in the world and fit your studies around your existing work or personal commitments. We use a Virtual Learning Environment to deliver this course, which offers you a highly interactive experience.
You will learn through:
Your own online study and research, which you can choose to do at times that suit you
Live, interactive sessions delivered by a module tutor, which are also recorded and available to watch later
Pre-recorded videos delivered by members of the academic team, which are available to watch at any time
Discussion boards, which enable you to work with other students on activities, or discuss a particular topic with fellow students and tutors
Guest lectures delivered by industry specialists, alumni, or CMI representatives, which will provide you with current insights
Support for your learning
You will get plenty of support, so if you are new to online learning or haven’t studied for a while, you don’t need to worry. You will be taught by our expert academics, who bring a wealth of experience and specialist knowledge to enrich your learning. There will also be a team of online learning advisors who will help you with any non-academic queries.
Pace of study
The academic year is made up of three, ten-week terms, known as trimesters. We recommend doing about 20 hours of study each week to complete one, 20-credit module over a trimester.
If you want to complete the course faster, you can choose to take our accelerated study plan. For this, you will need to study two modules in one trimester, which would mean about 40 hours of study each week. Think carefully before you choose the accelerated rate - it’s important that you have enough time to fully engage with your studies and produce the best work that you can. We often advise that you start by studying one module at the standard rate, before deciding whether to then increase to the accelerated rate of study.
Assessments
All your assessments will be coursework. Assignments vary so that you can develop a range of skills, but they may include essays, reports, projects, answering questions or various combinations of these submitted as a portfolio of work. Wherever appropriate, we try to ensure assignments bring in real-life business case studies or your own professional experiences.
Assignments may involve discussions with fellow students, but you will always be assessed individually.
All the resources you need to complete these assessments will be available electronically via our library, such as ebooks and journal articles.
