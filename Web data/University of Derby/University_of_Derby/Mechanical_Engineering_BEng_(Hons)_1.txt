The best bits
The course is accredited by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE)
You'll benefit from our close links with world-famous companies like Rolls-Royce, Alstom and Toyota
Specialist facilities include our additive manufacturing lab, wind tunnel and mechanical workshop
Challenge yourself with exciting extra-curricular projects like the IMechE Railway Challenge
Learn from an expert team of academic staff with extensive industrial experience
You have the option to transfer to another of our specialist engineering degrees after your first year
Meeting the needs of the industry - and you
Our Mechanical Engineering degree will give you the multi-disciplinary skills you'll need to succeed. And you'll have some amazing opportunities.
Employers are increasingly looking for skilled engineers with a broader knowledge of mechanical and electrical engineering. So we have developed our degrees to match that flexibility.
All engineering students take the same core modules in the first year to give you an essential engineering foundation. Then, at the end of your first year, you’ll have the opportunity to switch your course.
You can choose either our
BEng (Hons) Electrical and Electronic Engineering
or
BEng (Hons) Motorsport Engineering
degree should you realise your passion falls within this area. Or you can continue on our BEng (Hons) Mechanical Engineering.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
