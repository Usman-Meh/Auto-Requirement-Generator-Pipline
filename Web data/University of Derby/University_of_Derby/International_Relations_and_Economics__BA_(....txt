Our International Relations modules take a transdisciplinary approach to the study of world affairs and global issues, giving you the chance to undertake a comprehensive and critical interrogation of significant global issues. You’ll gain a profound understanding of a range of dynamic processes and trends that affect human societies, and how to navigate and influence some of the world’s most important and intractable questions and problems.
Alongside this you’ll also develop skills in applying economic theory, perspectives and approaches as a method for solving business and organisational problems across the private, public and third sectors both domestically and internationally.
Facilities and resources
Our Financial Markets Lab will give you a whole new perspective on what it’s like to work at the cutting edge of economics. You'll get hands-on experience with the software used in financial markets worldwide. You'll work with up-to-the-minute data and gain vital insights into financial market analysis.
The lab puts a wealth of data at your fingertips. You can access company and director profiles plus analysis of current affairs from financial intelligence. You’ll receive training from Bloomberg specialists and have access to their helpdesk. You can even work towards the Bloomberg Market Concepts Certificate. This will complement your degree qualification.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
