The highlights
Through optional modules, research projects and self-directed study, you can choose to focus on the issues and case studies you find particularly interesting
You will get the opportunity to write pieces for public audiences, such as a digital resource, an industry-facing symposium presentation, and a public policy paper
This is an MA History for the digital age. You will consider how historians can engage different audiences through modern media, learn to interpret digital data, and use digital tools to undertake and present research. In addition, two modules are delivered entirely online
We’ll make sure you have an exceptional student experience, with more contact hours than most universities and staff that go the extra mile.
Understand the past. Shape the future.
History has long been studied and used to help interpret the world around us, and it continues to play a central role in contemporary society. This MA lets you explore this relationship from all angles, using theories and approaches from other disciplines, such as anthropology and sociology, literary studies, psychology, science and medicine, as well as geography.
You will explore the historical context of many of the key themes shaping the modern world, such as:
the international legacy of the Enlightenment and reactions against Enlightenment ideals
the history of environmental issues
problems of globalisation and global inequalities in the wake of decolonisation, and
how history is used in politics and the media to shape present-day ideologies.
Our teaching team has expertise in British and global history, especially transnational histories, so you will build greater awareness of the historical authenticity of both your own and others’ cultures. Through your studies, you will learn to critically reflect on how you can contribute responsibly to a globally interconnected society.
"The MA in History at Derby prioritises innovative, experiential, and collaborative approaches to learning, placing you at the heart of the programme as co-creators of original historical knowledge. Our approachable team encourage you to critically assess the key historical themes that shape our modern world, in a way that reflects the public relevance of our discipline when tackling today's global challenges. These advanced skills, as well as an attentiveness to historicity in contemporary society, are particularly prized across the employment marketplace, helping you stand out in an increasingly crowded environment."
Dr Oliver Godsmark, Programme Leader
An emphasis on digital and public history
A key feature of this programme is that you will be encouraged to think about how historians can engage different audiences, and how they can make use of modern media to drive new research agendas and reach different sections of the public.
In several modules, you will get the opportunity to write pieces for public audiences, such as a public-facing digital resource, an industry-facing symposium presentation, and a public policy paper.
Of course, it’s now critical that historians have good digital skills so we put emphasis on this too. We encourage you to access valuable digital archives for instance, provide training in interpreting digital data, and have designed assessments that develop your digital skills — you might be expected to lead seminars using video conferencing software for example, and create websites and other digital content. Two of our modules are even delivered entirely online.
Research what you’re passionate about
This MA also helps you to build on the research skills you will have acquired during your first degree and allows you to develop original research on a subject of your choice in modern and/or public history, through an Independent Study module. It’s therefore excellent preparation for doctoral study.
We’ll support you to develop your research skills through several research-focused modules, which are designed to help you transition from undergraduate to postgraduate study and to enhance your awareness of complex theoretical perspectives in the humanities. You will survey key literatures, compile effective bibliographies and tackle ethical questions, combining practical skills with the ability to consider epistemological and methodological issues.

Please note that our modules are subject to change - we review the content of our courses regularly, making changes where necessary to improve your experience and graduate prospects.
How you will learn
Our interactive teaching style and our innovative assessment strategy will help you to develop your confidence, your critical thinking and communication skills, as well as your understanding of the subject.
You will learn through lectures, seminars, workshops and field trips, but because this is a masters, there is an emphasis on self-directed study and tutorials. History is a debate-led discipline so we encourage you to develop and strengthen your own voice. This means our classroom sessions always include plenty of discussion, whether they are lectures, seminars or workshops.
In nearly all modules, you will be encouraged to apply challenging theories and concepts to case studies of your own choice. This will mean taking as much responsibility as possible for your own learning, which allows you to develop into an independent and proactive critical thinker.
We have a blended learning strategy, so in addition to face-to-face teaching, you can also find materials for all modules on the virtual learning environment and take part in online discussions here.
Two of the modules are delivered entirely online and you can complete them at your own pace. However, you can always call on your tutor or peer group for support.
How you are assessed
You will take a wide range of assessments that help to build up your expertise (and independence) gradually. These ensure you are developing the key skills of the historical discipline as well as skills that will prepare you for life beyond university, such as advanced analytical, writing and oral communication skills.
For example, you will be asked to write essays, because these test your ability to distil information to form a coherent and focused argument, but there are also other written assignments — for instance producing policy papers and online digital resources — that will help you write for different audiences. You will be asked to analyse and contextualise evidence from different primary materials, including philosophical texts, historic landscapes and quantitative data. You will also be asked to give oral presentations and produce research symposiums.

Entry requirements
You will need a good honours degree (1st or 2:1) in a relevant humanities or social sciences subject, or its international equivalent. Applications may also be considered if you have a 2:2 honours degree, or a good honours degree in an unrelated subject, where you have significant relevant experience.
It is important that we get to know you, your aspirations, and your expectations. Therefore, depending on your qualifications and experience, you may be invited to attend an informal interview before being accepted onto the programme to discuss the course, the nature of the programme, and what will be expected of you during it. This may be a virtual interview or can be done over the telephone as well as face to face.
Non-standard applicants are encouraged to apply. Applications in these circumstances will be considered on their own individual merits.

Careers
Studying History at postgraduate level encourages you to become adept at critical and independent thinking, and at forming and articulating effective arguments. You will gain a host of transferrable skills, such as verbal and written communication, critical analysis and problem solving, teamwork and empathy. In addition, our MA particularly encourages your skills and understanding of public, digital and applied history, boosting your employability further.
This mix of skills makes MA History graduates attractive to a wide range of employers in areas such as teaching, libraries, museums and archives, accountancy, law, banking, retail and commercial management, human resources, marketing, the police and the armed services.
This MA will also prepare you well for doctoral study and careers in academia. It develops the independence and originality of thought you will need to complete a PhD and introduces you to the most recent developments in the discipline. The interdisciplinary nature of the programme means you could move on to further postgraduate study in other humanities subjects, not just History.
