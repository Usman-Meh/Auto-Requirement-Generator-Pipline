Why study Publishing and English?
Publishing and English at Derby is an exciting, diverse and challenging course that not only incorporates the close analysis of literature, but also considers the situations in which literature is produced and read. This means your studies will include the intellectual and cultural history of art, film, philosophy, linguistics and sociology, as well as contemporary cultural politics. You will be introduced to a range of cultural expression from across the globe and from diverse historical periods.
There is the opportunity to broaden your experience with work-based learning projects, study visits to cultural and heritage institutions, as well as lectures and seminars delivered by guest speakers.
The world needs writers and publishers
The UK market for written information and creative content of all types is of enormous significance to cultural and political life, as well as to economic growth. However, we live in a fast-changing society where consumers are bombarded with fake news and a flood of information daily. This means that carefully curated and diverse content is more important than ever.
The publishing industry is rapidly adapting to this evolving digital marketplace. It is a resilient, creative and global industry that continues to grow year-on-year. To do so, it relies on professionals who are commercially and digitally aware, and who feel passionate about books, writing and reading. Could that be you?
We blend the creative and the commercial
In today's publishing industry, authors, editors, literary agents and other professionals need to collaborate with each other to an unprecedented degree. If they have an understanding of each other’s roles and priorities, they can do this well. That’s why this course looks at the industry from both the perspective of the writer and the perspective of the publishing professional.
"I have been grateful to have dynamic lecturers who are supportive and knowledgeable about all aspects related to this creative industry. They make the learning process accessible and engaging. The lecturers have always challenged me to produce my best work and allowed me to develop a wide range of skills which will be invaluable in my career after graduation. The programme provides a range of modules which will open many different opportunities for me."
Fred Gough, Writing and Publishing Student

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.

Careers
We will provide you with the skills to critically engage with the world in which you live, as well as developing your understanding of cultural difference and of the capacity of language to produce unintended effects and meanings. Such awareness is hugely valuable to employers.
The UK publishing industry is proportionately the largest and most successful in the world, so you'll have an extensive range of career opportunities open to you. You could work as an author, editor or publisher of books, magazines or digital content. You could also consider a career as a literary agent, bookseller, or events co-ordinator at a book festival.
Outside of the publishing world, employers across all sectors always need people who can write and communicate well. The key skills you'll develop on this course — including writing, editing, group work and presentations — are essential for many roles, most obviously copywriters, marketers, advertising executives, events managers and publicists.
Graduates from our previous BA in Writing and Publishing went on to jobs in copywriting, arts development, librarianship, archive and record keeping, computer games and website design, teaching, marketing and law.
You may also choose to continue your studies at postgraduate level, for example on our MA Creative Writing or MA Publishing courses.
