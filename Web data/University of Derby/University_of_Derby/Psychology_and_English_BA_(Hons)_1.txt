Studying Psychology and English will bring out your creative and analytical mindsets to study an intellectually challenging but rewarding degree. This course is designed to help you become an effective, skilled and forward-thinking psychologist whilst incorporating a close analysis of literature.
This means your studies will include the intellectual and cultural history of art, film, philosophy, linguistics and sociology, as well as contemporary cultural politics. You will be introduced to a range of cultural expression from across the globe and from diverse historical periods.
We aim to broaden your understanding of how the human mind works, exploring a range of fundamental psychological theories to explain human behaviour and development. You'll be taught by expert staff who are conducting influential studies into areas of psychology such as mental health and wellbeing, compassion and mindfulness, autism and maths anxiety.

Specialist facilities
Our Psychology facilities are used for both teaching and research. They include computing labs with specialist software for designing experiments and research. You'll use a range of psychological recording equipment such as the latest eye-tracker equipment for analysing eye movement and our Babylab for ethical research with babies and young children. We also have a library that is well-resourced with both physical and digital materials enabling high-level literary critical study and research.
The ideal setting
You could not have a better backdrop to your studies than Derbyshire. One of the centres of the British Enlightenment during the eighteenth century, the county has a strong literary heritage and inspired many great writers including Jane Austen, Walter Scott, Charlotte Brontё, George Eliot and Henry James.
Study in America
You can choose to study part of your degree at one of our partner universities in America:
Eastern Michigan University
Keene State College in New Hampshire
Longwood University in Virginia
Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis
Accredited course*
British Psychological Society accreditation means we're delivering a high standard of psychology education. It shows we've met BPS standards for course content and design, and student development. It also means you can apply for BPS student membership. This provides:
Access to networking opportunities
The BPS student online community

The chance to transfer to graduate membership free of charge after completing your degree
And you will have the opportunity to progress to accredited postgraduate qualifications and training to gain chartered membership of the BPS.

Studying a Psychology and English Joint Honours degree allows you to choose whether you major in one subject or study them both equally.

How you will learn
For Psychology modules, you will learn from lecturers and tutors who are carrying out research designed to offer fresh perspectives on issues that are significant at every stage of life. Your lecturers bring their latest thinking to your studies. And, in some cases, you’ll have opportunities to get involved in research projects yourself. Quality inspectors have commended us for being “at the forefront of technology-enhanced learning” in Psychology.
For English modules, you will learn through lectures, seminars and tutorials. You will be taught in interactive and varied ways, with plenty of opportunity for you to discuss and debate ideas, so your course stays stimulating and thought-provoking. You will be able to test your ideas, clarify points and develop arguments based on your reading of primary and secondary sources. This will help you develop excellent communication skills, something that employers really value. You’ll also have the opportunity to write, market and deliver a conference paper in the second year, building a broader range of skills.
Real-world learning
You will have opportunities to undertake work-based learning projects and placements at cultural institutions as well as study visits to art galleries, cinemas, heritage centres, museums and theatres. We have worked closely, for instance, with the Derby-based 1623 Theatre Company, giving students the chance to try their hands at directing play scenes. Students have also worked with literary arts organisations such as Writing East Midlands and the Derby Book Festival on event programming and marketing.
How you are assessed
For English modules, our assessment strategy is designed to produce confident, articulate graduates with a broad set of skills. There are no exams and forms of assessment include seminar debates, group presentations and conference papers alongside essays and longer research projects. We place great emphasis on developing your research skills, with independent projects playing a key part in the second and third year of the programme.
For Psychology modules, you’ll be assessed mainly through assignments, via essays, posters, presentations, and reports. You may also have to take some exams. These can include essay questions, multiple choice and short answer questions.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
