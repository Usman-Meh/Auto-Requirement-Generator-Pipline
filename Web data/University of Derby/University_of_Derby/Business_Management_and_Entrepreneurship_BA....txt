This dynamic degree helps you to seize the initiative, generate business ideas and make them happen.
Professional recognition for your degree
Developed in close consultation with the Chartered Management Institute (CMI), this course puts you on the fast track to success. It is one of the few in the country where you’ll graduate with a highly regarded BA (Hons) Business Management as well as the CMI Level 5 Diploma in Management and Leadership.
The Diploma is the benchmark qualification for full CMI membership and takes you a step towards Chartered Manager status. There is no need to take extra exams or coursework to achieve the Diploma: our combined module and CMI assessments give you a smooth route to both qualifications.
An entrepreneuring outlook
Whether you have an idea for a business start-up or want to impress potential employers with your entrepreneurial mindset, this course will stand you in good stead. We have designed specialist modules which enable you to identify business opportunities, assess their potential and translate them into reality.
You will learn how to harness creativity to solve business problems and make better products and services. We explore the pros and cons of freelancing, the challenges of launching a business and how to take an innovative product to market. There is also a focus on how start-up ventures and small businesses can prosper in the global landscape.
Select the pathway to suit you
Flexibility is one of the most distinctive features of our Business Management suite of degrees. All students study the same modules in the first year to gain insights into the major business disciplines.
After your first year, you can choose to follow the specialist pathway in Entrepreneurship or – if you find your interests have changed – you can easily transfer to one of our other pathways in
HRM
,
Marketing
,
Finance
,
Business Technology
or
Supply Chain and Logistics
.  Alternatively, you could choose the core Business Management route, drawing on our extensive list of optional modules to develop a broader skillset.
This course is offered as a four year degree to include a placement year. You can, however, study on a three-year full-time basis, with opportunities for internships in the summer breaks.
A business mentor to support you
CMI accreditation
for our course introduces you to a privileged network of contacts. You’ll have the opportunity to be supported by a CMI mentor at every stage of your degree.
Your mentor will be a senior business person – either a Chartered Manager or Fellow of the CMI with a wealth of experience. From day one, they will advise and coach you from a business perspective, sharing their career insights and demonstrating how management theory can be applied in the workplace.
Throughout the degree, you will become an affiliate member of the CMI, at no extra cost, with access to networking events, guest lectures, online resources and additional benefits to support your career development and employability.
Test your entrepreneurial skills
Business simulations, topical case studies and business games – all provide practical scenarios in which to test your ideas and hone your enterprise skills.
The course culminates in a live consultancy project with an employer, where you will harness your research and project management skills to improve an organisation’s business performance.
Alongside your studies, you’ll work towards an additional qualification: the Futures Award in Business Work Experience. You’ll gain credits for extra-curricular activities which strengthen your development as a business professional.
Take responsibility in business
One of our priorities is to foster a new generation of responsible business leaders with a strong moral compass. Throughout the course, you will therefore look at the role of business in wider society, exploring issues ranging from environmental sustainability to child labour, ethical governance to responsible innovation.
Widen your networks
You can draw on our contacts with leading business names regionally, nationally and internationally as well as our thriving Network of Entrepreneurs. You’ll hear from people who have made their name in business, including Brett Butcher, our Entrepreneur in Residence and founder of Datapath Ltd, a world-leading innovator in computer graphics, video capture and digital technology.
We pride ourselves on our global student community. This course not only attracts students from all over the world to Derby but is also delivered for our educational partners across Europe and Asia. It means your learning will be enriched by truly international perspectives.
New Derby Business School in the city centre

How you will learn
We take a ‘scaffolded’ approach to learning, so you’ll have full support in the early stages of your course and can gradually move towards stronger understanding and greater independence. It’s a smooth transition to ease your way into both university-level study and business management practice.
Through your contact with personal tutors and CMI mentors – as well as your participation in University events – you’ll become more attuned to professional behaviour and will build your skills in critical thinking, creativity and self-reliance before immersing yourself in the wider business community.
The course incorporates formal lectures, sometimes involving guest speakers; tutor-led and student-led seminars; one-to-one and small group tutorials; work experience projects; work-related learning; self-directed study; optional placement and internship opportunities; and video discussions with overseas partner institutions.  By stage three, you are expected to be more in charge of your own learning, with module tutors advising and directing your studies.
How you are assessed
You will benefit from an innovative variety of assessment modes. Assessment is mainly via coursework which can take forms such as traditional essays and reports, group project work, research and consultancy projects, presentations, posters, and design of digital materials. There are also in-class tests and computer-based assessments.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
