Combine the study of human behaviour from the perspectives of both criminal and community justice professionals with a multi-disciplinary social science approach to education, focusing on current educational curriculum, policy and trends.
Who do we label as ‘offenders’, and why? Learn about human behaviour from the perspectives of both criminal and community justice professionals and wider society. You’ll explore the relationships of crime, deviance and offending, and victimisation to social divisions such as age, gender, sexuality, social class, race, ethnicity and religion.
Combine this with a multi-disciplinary social science approach to education, focussing on current educational curriculum, policy and trends. You’ll explore the concept of education through four key academic disciplines; sociology, history, psychology and philosophy to gain a broad understanding of education policy and practice.
Bringing theory to life
As well as traditional lectures and tutorial sessions, the programme features a strong practical element. You’ll develop your criminology skills through activities such as interviewing, negotiation, decision making, research and argument, and problem-based learning, ensuring that you achieve a wide-ranging understanding of systems of criminal and community justice. Our Criminology team work closely with courts, prisons and youth offender training centres, and bring this expertise into their teaching.
As part of your Education Studies modules, you could have the opportunity to undertake a work placement or work experience, take fieldtrips and study visits, or study abroad to explore education on a global scale.
Academic expertise
Research is visible in the programme through the creative input of teaching staff, who are experts in their curriculum areas and incorporate latest research in taught sessions and resources. Students are encouraged to pursue their own interests in many module seminars and assignments, which supports students in becoming active researchers in their own right.
Choose your pathway
Studying a Education Studies and Criminology Joint Honours degree allows you to choose whether you major in one subject or study them both equally.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
