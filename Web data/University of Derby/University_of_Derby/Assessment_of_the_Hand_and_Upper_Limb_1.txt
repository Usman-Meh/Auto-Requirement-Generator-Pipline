Module description
During this module you will become familiar with and investigate standardised and non-standardised hand and upper limb assessments, as well as techniques for assessing hand injuries and conditions, so that you can make informed decisions regarding assessment and treatment evaluation in your hand therapy.
A commonly expressed concern amongst hand therapists is the limited knowledge of and use of standardised hand assessments, in order to reliably and validly evaluate practice. This module will assist in meeting the requirements of the NHS to evaluate effectiveness and efficiency of interventions and expand hand therapy knowledge base.
This module is distance learning (online with work-based activities). Tutorial support is provided via telephone, email or online.
