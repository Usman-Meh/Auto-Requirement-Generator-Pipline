Boost your employability with a placement year
You’ll have the opportunity to take a placement year to put the skills you’ve learned into practice in a real-world environment. We'll support you to find your placement and throughout your year in industry. Placements allow you to gain valuable experience to add to your CV, make industry contacts and help you to narrow down what kind of role you may be interested in after graduation.
“I loved the idea that I could get a degree that covers many areas of interest and not restrict me to one subject. It has opened up so many opportunities for me; I have been to Berlin and Geneva as well as having chances to work with valuable companies and organisations which have cemented my future career decisions”. Chloe Bradbury, BA (Hons) Sociology.
Would you like to explore how the modern world has developed, where it’s going, and ways to bring about change for the better?  While we all have our own ideas about society, our BA (Hons) Sociology helps you build a more accurate picture of the dramatic and diverse changes influencing our lives today.
With flexibility and choice at its core, this degree is structured around the key avenues of crime and justice, youth cultures, politics and social justice, and security and terrorism. It means you can choose to focus on the combination of topics which match your personal interests and career aspirations.
We encourage you to think critically and ethically about social trends, developments and controversies. You will find yourself discussing highly topical issues such as social inequality, race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, globalisation, the impact of the digital era, the sociology of childhood and youth, the cult of celebrity, social movements and political engagement, marginal beliefs and the influence of conspiracy theories.
The degree is designed to deliver an engaging and enjoyable learning experience for all students from the outset – for those progressing directly from A-level Sociology and for those who bring other skills, knowledge and experiences to their studies.
Hands-on learning
At the end of your second year, there is an option for you to take a year placement in industry, in an occupation of your choice. Our Sociology in the World module in your third year also provides you with an opportunity to underake a placement alongside your studies.
Fieldtrips also feature in a number of modules so that you can see how institutions and organisations work ‘on the ground’, developing observational research skills to use in your own projects.
Expert teaching
The BA (Hons) Sociology is taught by a team which includes experienced researchers whose work is shedding new light on some of the most pressing issues facing our society.
They are recognised for their expertise in research areas such as social policy, childhood and war, extremism and counter terrorism, conspiracy theory, humour and society, politics and social movements, Marxism and social theory. They regularly publish their research findings, and deliver conference papers internationally.
As a Sociology student, you can take part in regular guest lectures and departmental research seminars delivered by leading professionals and eminent academics from other institutions.
Real-world research
We give you a thorough grounding in research methods, fieldwork, data collection and the analysis of statistics. Through your independent study module, you will have the chance to conduct in-depth research into the sociological themes that have most captured your interest.
By the end of your degree, you will have developed skills in applying research findings to practical uses, together with the ability to analyse arguments and the confidence to justify your opinions.
Study overseas
The focus of the BA (Hons) Sociology is international in scope and you will have every opportunity to look at the key sociological questions facing communities worldwide. This includes the chance to challenge your perspectives by studying overseas.
We offer you the opportunity to spend a semester in the lively Czech capital of Prague as part of our Erasmus partnership with Charles University. In your final year, you will also be eligible to go on a study trip to Berlin which is included in your course fees. Such experiences make an impressive addition to your CV, showcasing your resourcefulness, confidence and willingness to embrace global outlooks.
The Gateway to Your Legal Career
Our modern, iconic building offers state-of-the-art facilities like a replica Crown Court and Custody Suite. Just a short walk from the city centre, One Friar Gate Square is designed to elevate your academic journey.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
