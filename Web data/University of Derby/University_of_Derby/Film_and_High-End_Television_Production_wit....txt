For ambitious and creative film-makers
Explore the most exciting and challenging areas of contemporary film and high-end TV-making on a course designed to get you noticed in an intensely competitive industry. If you aspire to make big-budget productions for cinemas or small-screen streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon, this course will suit you. You’ll need to be highly creative, passionate and dedicated.
This degree is based on our long-established and successful BA (Hons) Film Production, and has been updated and renamed to be relevant to the media industry of the 2020s. We recognise that students today will want to make productions for streaming platforms just as much as for the big screen, so our course content has been updated to reflect this. We also give you the chance to experiment with other forms of media-making — such as apps, web video, podcasts and other digital content — so that you are prepared for the ‘multiplatform’ nature of the media industry today.

From raw talent to real deal
Through a blend of practical projects and more traditional teaching, you’ll develop the creative, technical and theoretical expertise needed to work within the moving image sector. We’ll cover these key areas:
Screenwriting and directing
Cinematography, sound and editing
Production, including 1st assistant directing
Film history and theory
Research skills
Employability skills.
You’ll work on a series of productions in a variety of on-set and post-production roles. The length and complexity of these productions will increase as you move through the course.
We are one of the few film courses in the UK which teach you to use both RED and ARRI cameras (high-spec digital cameras that the film industry use) as well as traditional celluloid or ‘35mm’. By the end of your final year, you will have built up an impressive portfolio of work that will help you gain employment or get accepted onto postgraduate programmes.
We’ll also make sure you leave with a great understanding of the film and television industry so you know how to create products that get seen by an audience. Plus, you will develop the professional skills you’ll need to deal with clients, commercial briefs, audiences and markets.
Developing you as an artist
As well as developing your technical, commercial and professional abilities, we’re also focused on helping you develop as an artist. You will be challenged to think beyond conventional ideas about media content, and explore how you can push and break boundaries. We’ll encourage you to experiment and see failures as a learning opportunity, as you develop your own unique voice.
Experience real film and TV sets
Thanks to our high-profile teaching team, you’ll get plenty of opportunities to work on real film and TV sets, for instance as runners and crowd marshalls. In addition, final year students get the chance to compete for a six-month placement with a production company in Malta, which is one of the most popular locations for films outside of America. This is potentially a career-making opportunity, and has led to some phenomenal successes.
Mari Olan spent a five-month placement at Malta Film Studios and worked on a variety of film projects, including acting as Second Assistant Director on a major film production.

Showcase your work. Win awards.
All our students get the chance to showcase their work in festivals and competitions. In 2019, our students took home three top prizes from The Royal Television Society Awards, including The Sir Lenny Henry Award for Excellence. While in 2020, student

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
