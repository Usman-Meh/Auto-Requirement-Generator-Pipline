Publishing blends the creative and the commercial
The world needs writers and publishers. The UK market for written information and creative content is significant to cultural and political life, as well as economic growth. We live in a fast-changing society where carefully curated and diverse content is more important than ever. The publishing industry is rapidly adapting to this evolving digital marketplace – it is a resilient, creative and global industry that relies on commercially and digitally aware professionals.
In today's publishing industry, authors, editors, literary agents and other professionals need to collaborate with each other to an unprecedented degree. If they have an understanding of each other’s roles and priorities, they can do this well. That’s why this course looks at the industry from both the perspective of the writer and the perspective of the publishing professional.
Specialist facilities
Our Psychology facilities are used for both teaching and research. They include computing labs with specialist software for designing experiments and research. You'll use a range of psychological recording equipment such as the latest eye-tracker equipment for analysing eye movement and our Babylab for ethical research with babies and young children.
Accredited course*
British Psychological Society accreditation means we're delivering a high standard of psychology education. It shows we've met BPS standards for course content and design, and student development. It also means you can apply for BPS student membership. This provides:
Access to networking opportunities
The BPS student online community
Discounts on books
Events and e-learning
Academic journals
The chance to transfer to graduate membership free of charge after completing your degree
And you will have the opportunity to progress to accredited postgraduate qualifications and training to gain chartered membership of the BPS.
For students to receive the Graduate Basis for Chartered Membership (GBC) of the British Psychological Society (BPS), students need to do the following:
Choose a Psychology major pathway with all prescribed modules

Choose your pathway
Studying a Psychology and Publishing Joint Honours degree allows you to choose whether you major in one subject or study them both equally.
You begin this degree by studying both subjects equally in your first year. By the end of your first year, you will then decide whether you would like to major or minor in a chosen subject or continue to study them both equally.

Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Publishing with Psychology
In this pathway, Publishing is the major subject and Psychology is the minor subject.

How you will learn
For Psychology modules, you will learn from lecturers and tutors who are carrying out research designed to offer fresh perspectives on issues that are significant at every stage of life. Your lecturers bring their latest thinking to your studies. And, in some cases, you’ll have opportunities to get involved in research projects yourself. Quality inspectors have commended us for being “at the forefront of technology-enhanced learning” in Psychology.
For Publishing modules, you will learn through a mixture of lectures, seminars, tutorials, creative writing workshops, project work, technology-enhanced learning, peer reviews and presentations.
We also arrange visits to literary festivals, local and national museums, cultural heritage sites and other areas of interest for 'location writing' exercises.
How you are assessed
For Publishing modules you will mostly be assessed by coursework which could include written work such as stories, poetry, scripts, blogs and press articles, traditional essays and presentations.
For Psychology modules, you’ll be assessed mainly through assignments, via essays, posters, presentations, and reports. You may also have to take some exams. These can include essay questions, multiple choice and short answer questions.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
