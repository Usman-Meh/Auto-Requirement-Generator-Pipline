Some modules offer the chance to study abroad to gain a global marketing perspective

National Student Survey 2024
Marketing is exciting and fast-paced and is now relevant to almost all organisations, whether they operate in the private, public or third sector. Every business has a requirement to market their goods or services. Some have in-house teams that create campaigns, and others outsource them to creative agencies. However, all have a requirement to plan, implement, and monitor marketing activity if a business is to be successful or profitable.
With the rise of digital media, the number and variety of marketing channels has grown. This increasingly complex landscape has had a knock-on effect on jobs, creating a need for more specialist roles in sub-sectors such as content marketing, affiliate marketing, social media management and search engine optimisation. We have responded to these changes in the profession through our modules and courses, to reflect the need for these specialist skills.
We equip you with the knowledge, confidence and creativity to shape an organisation’s marketing strategy and help it develop a customer-led approach to business opportunities. You’ll learn how to combine all elements of the marketing mix and how to get the best from in-house teams or outsourced agencies.
Real-world experience
On this marketing degree, we take you beyond the classroom, giving you opportunities for real-world experience. Thanks to our strong links with employers, you'll get the chance to work on real marketing projects, meeting clients and presenting your proposed solutions to their challenges. Recently, our students found themselves drawing up plans to:
promote new events
raise a company's profile through social media
attract more visitors to a destination, and
create a brand identity for a pub-based arts venue
Using our industry contacts, we'll support you to find internships, provide a varied programme of interesting guest speakers and draw on fascinating real-world case studies to bring marketing concepts and principles to life.
Study abroad
Why not study abroad for a semester? It's a great chance to experience a different country and culture, perhaps develop an additional language, make new connections and bring back new ideas.
Marketing students visit Dublin
Our final year Marketing students recently had the opportunity to visit Dublin to explore global brands, international media and learn about the importance of arts, culture and heritage marketing.

Research projects
How you are assessed
You will be assessed through coursework, which will incorporate individual assignments as well as group tasks. These focus on applying what you have learned to real business scenarios and producing the kind of work that might be expected in a marketing role, for example:
Written reports based around research, including data and case studies
Visual presentations
Creative outputs such as infographics, short advertisements, films or bespoke projects for clients
Online assessments

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
