Module description
Development of communications skills for healthcare professionals has been identified as 'a continuing process throughout (their) professional careers particularly when moving into specialist areas' (DoH, 2003).
To be able to perform at the forefront of professional practice expertise is required in a range of communications strategies, where they are oftenÂ utilised in complex, sensitive or contentious situations.
This module will provide the opportunity for you to assess your individual communication skills needs and evaluate relevant theoretical principles and your application to practice. The module will be structured around a needs analysis leading to a negotiated learning contract.
Initially a 'needs analysis' of communications skills will be undertaken. You will then be able to select three specific areas of communications for further study.
