Study early childhood years whilst building a solid basis in entrepreneurship to give you the skills to launch your own business or bring innovation to an existing one.
Through your Early Childhood Studies modules, you will develop your academic, critical and practical skills in a range of professional services related to early childhood in the disciplines of health, education and social care. You will gain a broad knowledge base of theory and practice within the field of early childhood education and care, focussing on conception to the age of eight.
Alongside this you will study a range of business and entrepreneurship modules, giving you valuable skills to start your own business, act in a freelance capacity or be enterprising within an SME or large company environment.
Real-world experience
You’ll have plenty of opportunities to build on your CV before you graduate with a range of industry experience and placement opportunities. You’ll have the chance to work on industry briefs solving problems for real businesses, and you can choose to take an entrepreneurship-based placement year between the second and third year of your degree. Our Early Childhood Studies modules have the option of completing assessed placement experiences within a diverse range of provisions.
Make a difference to society
Our Early Childhood Studies modules seek to meet the demand for the provision of integrated services for young children and their families. We aim to empower our graduates to act as agents for change, advocating for equality, diversity, and social justice through their professional roles across a range of sectors.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
