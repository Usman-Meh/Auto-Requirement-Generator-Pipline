Foundation Year - helping you to achieve more
Including a foundation year as part of your four-year study programme will give you a head start in your academic and professional life. The foundation year offers the chance to strengthen your skills, knowledge and confidence – with extensive support from our expert staff – before you advance to stage one of your honours degree. It could also be beneficial if you are planning a career change and want to get to grips with aspects of subjects which are new to you.
Our degrees with a foundation year are continuous, meaning that you won’t need to apply again once you have successfully completed the first year.

The highlights
You'll learn how to manage hospitality venues and so much more: we'll also give you the leadership and entrepreneurial skills needed to excel in the hospitality industry - a sector that needs reshaping and rebuilding after the Covid pandemic
You'll learn how hospitality, tourism and events overlap to make up the wider 'visitor economy', and work closely with Events and Tourism students - this will broaden your career options
You can study abroad for a semester in stage two, and take a placement year before stage three
This programme is part of our Centre for Contemporary Hospitality and Tourism, which has been awarded the prestigious
International Centre of Excellence (ICE) in Tourism and Hospitality accreditation
All modules align with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, so you will learn to think about the social and environmental impacts of hospitality and balance this against the economic benefits it brings
Designed for 2021 and beyond
This BA (Hons) International Hospitality Management degree is designed to give you the management and operational skills needed to succeed in the hospitality industry of the 2020s and beyond. We have a track record of running successful hospitality management degrees, and now we've updated our curriculum to be even more relevant to the industry today.
In particular, we've included more content about business management, new technology, entrepreneurship and sustainability, so you graduate as a modern, adaptable and creative thinker who is not afraid to challenge the status quo and lead on change.
We've also redesigned the modules so that instead of studying specific modules in Finance, Marketing, HR and the other business disciplines, we teach these subjects throughout the course at points where they are most relevant. For instance, you will build your financial knowledge as you learn to create business plans, and you will develop HR and leadership skills as you learn how to change and transform an organisation.
Hospitality and the visitor economy
This programme is part of our Centre for Contemporary Hospitality and Tourism, which is an accredited International Centre of Excellence (ICE). Because of this, it shares key generic modules with our International Tourism Management and Event Management degrees, so you can appreciate how these three specialisms work together to make up the 'visitor economy' (the services and experiences that attract visitors to a destination.)
You will still focus on hospitality - through activities, assessments and specialist modules - but you'll also develop broader business management knowledge and get the chance to take optional modules in event management and tourism subjects. It means you'll have a wider skillset when you graduate and a greater choice of career paths and postgraduate courses.
New Derby Business School in the city centre
We're building a new Derby Business School, serving as an international centre of excellence. The superb new teaching facilities will build on our established reputation for inspirational teaching and research excellence, as we shape the next generation of qualified business leaders.

Key areas of learning
You'll cover the full range of modern-day hospitality management and business management skills. You'll learn to problem-solve and adapt to changing external environments, create innovative hospitality 'concepts' and customer experiences while considering sustainability, and plan, manage and evaluate projects. You'll also use digital technology throughout the course.
We'll cover topics such as the hotel industry, including luxury hotels and resorts, revenue management strategies and tools, and operations management. We'll look at many emerging issues - for instance, the impact of new technology on hospitality, such as simulation, self-service technology, and using AR and VR to enhance the guest experience. You'll discover how hospitality can be made more sustainable and be based on 'circular economy' principles: designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use for as long as possible, and regenerating natural systems.
There are also interesting optional modules in areas such as hotel data analytics, menu design and sensory evaluation, talent management and consumer behaviour.
We'll teach you key transferable skills, such as how to research, analyse and present data, how to launch a new business, manage finances and lead teams. You will also build up knowledge of current hospitality software, including POS and inventory control. Overall, you'll graduate with a diverse skillset, a 'can-do' attitude and the knowledge and confidence to go out and make your mark in the hospitality industry.
Practical projects
Throughout the course, you'll be asked to complete a wide range of tasks and activities that a hospitality manager might do, so you build up practical experience and can apply what you're learning.
For example, you might be asked to design and deliver a hospitality experience for a specific customer group, research and analyse future trends, create a video to promote a customer experience package, design a new menu, or develop and pitch business proposals.
Sometimes employers will come in to set challenges that are based on a real problem faced by their own organisation. Working with them can be a great way to build up experience of the industry and increase your network.
Work placements and internships - at home and abroad
We'll encourage and support you to take work placements and internships, at home or abroad. In stage two you must complete at least 30 hours of work experience and then between stage two and three, you can take an optional placement year or a summer internship. This is a valuable opportunity to gain experience and develop your practical skills 'on the job'.
We have strong links with major international employers such as Ennismore, Marriott, Best Western, Conrad Hilton, The Royal Lancaster, Loews Hotels and Resorts, Old Edwards and various country clubs across America. Within the UK, our connections include Skibo Castle, Royal Dornach and a host of smaller independent restaurants. Many of our previous students have landed placements or internships with these and other employers, which has really boosted their CV and career prospects.
Studying abroad and overseas trips
In stage two, you will get the opportunity to study abroad. You'll be able to choose from a range of countries, such as the Netherlands, Germany, Thailand, Bali and South Africa. It's a great way to experience a different culture, gain a new perspective on your subject, and have an adventure!
There are also plenty of opportunities to take part in study trips overseas and in the UK, with Tourism and Events students.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.

Careers
You'll graduate from this degree as a confident and creative hospitality specialist with strong business acumen and great awareness of the wider visitor economy. If you want to launch your own business or work for a start-up, you'll have the enterprising attitude and attributes that are needed, including resilience, self-awareness and independent thinking.
If you prefer to work for an employer, you'll be well-suited to a range of roles in the hospitality, event or tourism sectors, as well as allied industries such as marketing, PR or HR. You could initially apply for roles such as Food and Beverage or Event Supervisor, Front Office or Housekeeping Supervisor, Assistant Restaurant Manager, Graduate Trainee Hotel Manager, Business Development Manager or Marketing Executive. However, several years into your career, we think you'll be leading, inspiring and shaping the future of the visitor economy.
