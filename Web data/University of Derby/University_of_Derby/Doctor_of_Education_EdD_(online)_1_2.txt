Education in its broadest sense
Our Doctor of Education (EdD) has a broad appeal: you do not have to be a teacher, tutor or lecturer to benefit, although many of our students are. The programme is relevant to professionals engaged in learning, teaching, coaching, development, education policy and administration in a vast range of occupations and settings.
Our students work in education establishments, health and social care, commercial management and training, organisational development and improvement, business and the voluntary sector.
Research with real impact
This is an intellectually challenging programme which will stimulate your professional thinking. We will equip you to undertake a substantial, robust research project in the context of your own practice.
Directly relevant to your working role, your independent study enables you to create and interpret new professional knowledge, support innovative approaches and improve quality. It yields significant benefits for your organisation and your own potential for further career development.
Structured for success
The first two years of the programme are designed to build your skills and confidence to engage in doctoral level study and to research your professional field. Individual tutorials offer essential guidance to steer your progress and thought-provoking seminar groups enable you to share experiences with fellow students from a wide range of backgrounds. This provides a firm foundation for your independent research during years three to six as you develop your thesis with the support of a team of supervisors.
Academic rigour and expertise
Our online Doctor of Education (EdD) course is delivered by research active tutors and supervisors who have expertise across all educational spheres and regularly publish their work. They will keep you abreast of latest thinking and challenge your perceptions.
The programme draws on the cutting-edge educational research for which the University is renowned in the following areas:
Career Development and Employability
Technical and Vocational Education and Training
Inclusion and Special Educational Needs
Apprenticeship
Teacher Education and Innovation, and
Childhood
Our staff conduct influential studies on a range of topics from early years to adult learning, and we provide consultancy for government, schools and the wider education sector. This means your learning will be underpinned by innovative ideas which are changing the face of the education professions.

How you will learn
The teaching and research supervision phase are delivered entirely online. The two years of the taught phase of the programme combine self-study with asynchronous interactions to enhance your learning meaning, you will be given access to our instructional materials each week and you will complete the activities at your own pace. Our online learning resources include an online discussion board, multimedia, and a live tutorial. You will access all the study materials, seminars, and tutorials through our virtual learning environment. This will enhance your learning experience, as you will learn both with and from your peers and the academic staff.
How you are assessed
Assessments provide a variety and range of tasks which go beyond the requirements of the academic essay. These facilitate professionals such as yourself in articulating and disseminating your expertise.
Over the course of the whole programme, you will undertake the following:
An analysis of the nature of practitioner research within professional practice
A reflective literature review focused on your area of study
An extended essay justifying your chosen educational research methodology for your professional research. You will consider research ethics and an appreciation of contemporary philosophical debates about educational research
A viva voce examination of a professionally researched thesis
Pace of Study
This programme is only available part-time online and can be completed in four years. To achieve your Professional Doctorate, you will need to complete two 60-credit modules in year one and year two and an Independent Research for Practice module (420 credits) in year three and four, with a maximum registration period of eight years.
The academic year is made up of three 10-week terms, known as trimesters. The postgraduate taught 60-credit modules are therefore taken over the whole academic year and we recommend about 20 hours of study per week to complete 20-credits per 10-week trimester.
