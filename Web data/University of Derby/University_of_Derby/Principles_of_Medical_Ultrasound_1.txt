About this module
This module is for:
Career sonographers - your primary role will be the provision of a diagnostic ultrasound service. Normally you will be employed in a general imaging department and planning to begin training in a broad range of ultrasound examinations or you may wish to extend your current ultrasound practice.

The key themes explored within the module include the physical principles of ultrasound imaging, equipment design and function, image optimisation, interpretation of ultrasound appearances and ultrasound safety.
The module will be delivered through a blended learning approach that includes directed study and online distance learning materials supported byÂ five themed on-campus study days and work based learning activities. In addition, you will require access to a suitable clinical placement for a recommended minimum of 14 hours (two days) per week supervised scanning practice for the duration of the module.
