Psychology subject area - Complete University Guide 2025
Psychology and Sociology are fascinating academic disciplines, opening doors to a wide range of careers after graduation where you can have a real impact on society. You'll be taught by expert staff who are conducting influential studies into areas of psychology such as mental health and wellbeing, compassion and mindfulness, autism and maths anxiety.
Would you like to explore how the modern world has developed, where it’s going, and ways to bring about change for the better?  While we all have our own ideas about society, this course helps you build a more accurate picture of the dramatic and diverse changes influencing our lives today.
We encourage you to think critically and ethically about social trends, developments and controversies. You will find yourself discussing highly topical issues such as social inequality, race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, globalisation, the impact of the digital era, the sociology of childhood and youth, the cult of celebrity, social movements and political engagement, marginal beliefs and the influence of conspiracy theories.
Specialist facilities
Our Psychology facilities are used for both teaching and research. They include computing labs with specialist software for designing experiments and research. You'll use a range of psychological recording equipment such as the latest eye-tracker equipment for analysing eye movement and our Babylab for ethical research with babies and young children.
Our Sociology facilities are based at One Friar Gate Square. Offering the perfect environment for innovative and engaging teaching, it includes well-resourced lecture theatres, seminar rooms and social learning spaces.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
