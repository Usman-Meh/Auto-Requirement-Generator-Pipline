If the arts have played a vital role in your own personal development, why not harness your creativity to make a difference in other people’s lives? Our pioneering BA (Hons) Creative Expressive Arts, Health and Wellbeing programme allows you to apply your skills in art, dance, drama, and music towards making a difference to the lives of others and encourages you to integrate them with confidence.
This programme offers you opportunities to develop your skills and express yourself in the art form of your choice through specialist studio sessions, performances and exhibition work. Playful exploration of all art forms will empower you in applying the arts as a tool when working with others to promote physical and emotional wellbeing.
We explore how the arts and creativity can be applied therapeutically in community, voluntary, health, educational, and corporate settings. We also look at different therapeutic principles and the meanings of health and illness in the context of historical, societal, and cultural values, and the role of the arts in meeting personal and community goals and needs.

Real-world learning in action
At every level of study, we offer exciting opportunities for you to put your skills into practice – and make more informed decisions about your future career path – through work placements and community projects.
At Level 6 of the course, you will undertake a placement thanks to our partnerships where you could gain experience with arts groups, hospitals, hospices, schools, charities, or organisations supporting adults and children with disabilities. This is a fantastic opportunity to work creatively using multiple art forms to make a difference to the lives of your participants.
Many of our students take part in collaborative projects in the wider community and have devised and led drama sessions for prison inmates; run creative arts workshops for people with brain injuries; and toured schools with programmes aimed at tackling bullying and peer pressure. The programme also encourages strong links to nature and using it as an inspiration for creativity and notions of sustainability and wellbeing through its recognised support of good mental health.
Gain ‘career-ready’ skills
You will undertake a substantial amount of groupwork where you can reflect on your own personal development, awareness, and communication skills. You will also also gain experience of leadership, coaching, and group processes which will be invaluable in your future career.
There are opportunities for you to learn with, and from, students from other disciplines. This will prepare you to work in a multi-professional and multi-disciplinary teams after graduation, and ensure the best possible outcomes for your clients and service users.
An inspiring study experience
You will hone your skills in our superb
facilities
, including dedicated art, dance, drama, and music studios for the arts.
We offer guest lectures by leading professionals in the field, and you will also take part in environmental, site-specific arts workshops, as part of the ‘Big Wood’ project, based on the outskirts of Derby, to help you think beyond studio spaces and connect more strongly with nature and the natural world.
Pursue your personal interests
Your course will culminate in an Independent study which allows you to explore areas of your own choosing within the applied arts & health subject area, whilst also offering a platform to demonstrate your academic and/or creative talents to potential employers.
This could take the form of either a  scholarly, theory-led dissertation, or a practice-led body of work such as drama, dance, or music performance(s) or an art exhibition, together with supportive written work.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
