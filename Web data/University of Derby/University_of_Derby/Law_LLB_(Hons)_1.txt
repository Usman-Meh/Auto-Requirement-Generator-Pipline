In the below video, Head of Derby Law School, Sue Jennings, answers some of the most frequently asked questions about Law at the University of Derby.
View Law - your questions answered! video transcript
I chose Derby because of the emphasis placed on practicality which set it apart from others. Another factor was the welcoming atmosphere that was apparent when you entered the building. It was the first university that just felt right.
Gemma Wood
LLB (Hons) Graduate
Derby LLB
Offering you an exceptional experience of studying law, the Derby LLB is designed to reflect the changing legal profession and set you apart in the graduate job market.
We deliver a comprehensive all-round undergraduate legal education, so you’ll gain all the skills and hands-on experience you need to have an immediate impact in a legal career. You'll engage with the core professional skills, bringing what you read in the textbooks to life through genuine practical experience.
At the same time, you’ll focus on the broader skills required by modern-day lawyers, going beyond providing legal advice and resolving legal disputes. You’ll be introduced to areas such as legal technology, commercial awareness, entrepreneurship and strategic thinking while developing empathy, innovation and creativity to help you stand out from the crowd. You’ll also explore how your legal knowledge can shape your future role in society, helping you to make a genuine difference to social justice.
Specialist pathways
The Derby LLB is all about flexibility and choice. You can decide to study a broad-based LLB or follow a specialist pathway to a named LLB award by taking particular modules at stage 3. The pathways are:
LLB (Hons) Company and Commercial Law
LLB (Hons) International and Comparative Law
LLB (Hons) Social and Public Policy
LLB (Hons) International Business Law
Professional recognition
The Derby LLB meets stringent criteria set by the
Bar Standards Board
and
Solicitors Regulation Authority
and covers all the foundations of legal knowledge. As a ‘qualifying law degree’, it offers exemptions from the academic stage of study if you want to progress to become a barrister or solicitor.
Hands-on learning
Derby Law School has an ethos of ‘learning by doing’ to build your employability skills and ensure you’re work-ready on graduation. We offer different variations of real-world learning to take legal education out of the abstract and into reality – from mooting competitions and mock trials to drafting contracts and bail applications.
Work internships enable you to learn more about the legal sector. Through the Law School’s excellent relationship with the local legal profession, some of our students in previous years have had the opportunity to undertake work internships with local Government, local charities, Citizens Advice Bureau, the NHS legal department and the University of Derby Legal Department. The Law School actively supports students in identifying work internships where possible.
A vibrant programme of ‘paid for’ study visits will give you insights into the profession, including fieldtrips to local courts. Previous students on our LLB (Hons) have also toured London, including the Supreme Court and the Houses of Parliament and as well as visited The Hague, the legal capital of the world, where you can see the international courts in action. Students have also had the opportunity to visit Dublin to explore a different legal system.
Links with the profession
Contributions from the wider legal community, including regular careers talks and workshops, are central to this course. Through our professional mentoring scheme, practitioners from the legal field will share their perspectives with you. All students on the course are eligible to apply for this scheme. Previous mentors have included serving judges, solicitors and barristers. In some cases this has led to internships, part-time paralegal work and even permanent jobs for our students.
A highlight of our academic calendar is a prestigious black-tie law dinner where you can network with members of the local judiciary and legal profession. In addition, the Derby Junior Lawyers group invites our students to networking events and social opportunities. You can also join our active student Law Society.
Student Legal Advice Centre and Pro Bono work
Our
Student Legal Advice Centre
enables you to build your skills in clinical legal practice by offering free advice and assistance to members of the public. You have the opportunity to experience real-world learning. Volunteering in the Centre provides you the opportunity to develop transferrable skills that will assist you in gaining the skills required once you graduate – and not limited to a career as a solicitor.
Through the Centre, you’ll work under the close supervision of a qualified solicitor to help members of the community in a range of legal areas. The Centre offers assistance in the following areas:
Family law
Criminal injuries compensation authority claims
Immigration family reunion (in partnership with British Red Cross and Paragon Law)
The Centre also offers support to Litigants in Person in Family Law matters at the Family Court at Derby. If you are representing yourself in a Family Law matter, a student volunteer can attend Court with you to support you, take notes and following the hearing discuss the outcome of the hearing with you. In Autumn 2022, a Business Clinic and Legal Triage Clinic (exclusively for University of Derby students) will also be launched.
Depending upon which clinic you volunteer in within the Centre, you will have the opportunity to meet with clients, take instructions, carry out research and advise accordingly.
The Centre also has a Policy Clinic and Justice Project. The Justice Project promotes the teaching of law to all members of the community, including school children, by informing them of their legal rights and responsibilities. When volunteering in the Policy Clinic, you will have the opportunity to carry out research for non-government organisations.
The Centre was recently shortlisted for Best Contribution by a Law School at the LawWorks and Attorney General Student Pro Bono Awards 2022, and was highly commended at the LawWorks Pro Bono Awards 2021 for Best contribution in relation to the Centre’s Immigration Family Reunion Clinic.
Expert teaching
Our teaching team includes barristers, solicitors, criminal psychologists, sociologists and experienced police officers. Several are still actively engaged with practice, which helps you keep up to date with contemporary issues in justice. Our teaching is also enriched by research covering some of the most pressing issues confronting society today, from slavery to digital privacy.
The LLB (Hons) is supported by visiting professors and guest lecturers who are leading authorities in their fields. Our celebrated Public Lecture Series also brings influential figures to the University to shed new light on the legal system.
Facilities
Law students are based on the Derby Campus at
One Friar Gate Square
. It includes a mock court room, replica custody suite and social learning hubs where you can develop your skills and familiarise yourself with the type of environments you’ll encounter in real-life legal situations.
Study overseas
We offer you the opportunity to spend time studying abroad thanks to our extensive network of global associates, including universities in Pisa, Naples, Paris, The Hague and Brno in the Czech Republic. These not only ensure our curriculum is truly international but also pave the way for exchange opportunities.

How you will learn
Engaging in real or simulated legal practice, you will build a range of the key skills required to succeed in the legal sector at every stage of the course, including:
case preparation
mooting - where you present a legal issue against opposing counsel in a mock court case
interviewing
negotiation
You will also develop skills in legal scholarship, with the chance to undertake problem-based research and original academic enquiry. If our teaching team consider the work you produce to be of sufficient quality, it could be published in the Derby Law School Journal.
Through our peer assisted mentoring scheme, students from later years of the course also give helpful guidance and support to first year students.
Showcasing your skills
Mooting forms part of certain modules and you can develop your expertise further through regional and national competitions. We have an excellent record of success in these challenges.
In your third year, our annual Legal Skills Triathlon, run in partnership with Derby & District Law Society, will test your advocacy, interview and negotiation skills. You will compete in teams with newly qualified lawyers and will be judged by a professional panel. Some of our students have secured jobs as a direct result of this experience.
We also help run a schools’ debating competition in partnership with Derby & District Law Society and Enterprise for Education where you can mentor local secondary school pupils.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.

Careers
Our LLB (Hons) graduates go on to take up roles as barristers, solicitors, paralegals and chartered legal executives and can be found working in private practice, the Crown Prosecution Service, the courts, law centres, the police service, local and national government.
Completion of the LLB represents the end of the academic stage of your training. To become a solicitor or barrister, you must then continue to complete the vocational stage of your training:
If you wish to become a solicitor, you will need to complete the Legal Practice Course (LPC), or Solicitors Qualifying Examination (SQE). Our graduates are highly sought after by solicitors’ firms because of their practical skills underpinned by academic rigour. At Derby, we offer the
LLM LPC
, which equips you with both a masters qualification and the LPC. We are currently developing an SQE provision.
If you wish to become a barrister, you must take a one-year full-time or two-year part-time Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC). Our students are particularly successful at winning substantial scholarships for the BPTC, which is testimony to the calibre of teaching we offer. Please note, we do not offer the BPTC at the University of Derby
Even if you do not want to become a legal practitioner, the LLB acts as a stepping stone to careers in broader areas. Legal skills ensure you can make a strategic contribution in many professions including the civil service, investment banking, management and tax consultancy, compliance, insurance, HR, politics, town planning, construction, publishing and education. They will also prove helpful if you want to launch your own business.
Further study
If you would like to take your studies to postgraduate level, the Derby
LLM
is a masters degree offering maximum flexibility, choice and opportunity. We also offer the
LLM Legal Practice Course
which equips you with a masters qualification and includes the Legal Practice Course (LPC) needed for professional practice as a Solicitor.
As a graduate of the University of Derby, you may be entitled to
Alumni discount
on your postgraduate course fees. Terms and conditions apply.
