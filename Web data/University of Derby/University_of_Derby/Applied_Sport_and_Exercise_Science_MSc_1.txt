Careers
If you’re interested in pursuing a career centred on sport and exercise science, this MSc offers an excellent learning experience. You could work as an applied sport scientist with clients such as professional athletes or you could embark on broader roles in the community and health sectors where you can help encourage behaviour change and healthy lifestyles.
The course also acts as a platform if you want to continue on to complete a programme of Supervised Experience with BASES, which would enable you to gain accreditation as a Sport and Exercise Scientist. Studying the psychology pathway will help position students for an application to the BASES Sport and Exercise Psychology Accreditation Route (SEPAR) and therefore train to become a Sport and Exercise Psychologist.
By choosing the Performance Analysis pathway, you'
ll graduate with confidence in analysing applied sports performance via video and data on relevant software programmes such as Sportscode and R, to suit the needs of a variety of audiences, including individual athletes and sports teams.
Having improved your research skills, you could think about taking your academic qualifications to the next level, by completing a doctoral programme such as a PhD. You could also consider progressing to a role in teaching.
