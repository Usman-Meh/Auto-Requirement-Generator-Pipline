Take a transdisciplinary approach to the study of world affairs and global issues and tackle a range of issues to gain an insight into the trends that affect human societies, policies and the planet so you can navigate and influence some of the world’s most important questions and problems.
Explore how the modern world has developed, where it’s going, and ways to bring about change for the better. While we all have our own ideas about society, our course helps you build a more accurate picture of the dramatic and diverse changes influencing our lives today.
Real-world learning
On your International Relations modules, you will get the opportunity to devise solutions to real problems and present your ideas to external audiences. In year two for example, there is a work experience module in which you'll be expected to work with a group, organisation or company on a project that either recommends or implements change. Then in year three, you'll get another opportunity to problem-solve with an advanced community or digital project. So even while you're studying, you will have the chance to start making a difference.
Your Sociology modules will explore a variety of societal issues such as media, culture and society, patterns of inequality, globalisation and social change, youth justice, the sociology of politics and protest and a Sociology Independent module providing you with a full understanding of societal issues.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
