With a dynamic and innovative curriculum, our new MA programme enables you to focus on the role of history in the public sphere and equips you for careers ranging from museum curation to heritage education.
Join a thriving industry
The evidence of the past surrounds us and is constantly called upon, reshaped and reimagined in the present.
Research conducted by
Historic England
in 2015 revealed how heritage now plays a key role in the broader economy of the UK, driving international tourism and generating income for local communities.
The strong growth in visitor numbers at historic properties since 2001 also underlines how the heritage industry is not only a major source of employment but also one of the most frequent ways that members of the public engage with the past.
Our MA Public History and Heritage has been launched to help you make the most of the many career opportunities emerging in this burgeoning industry. It offers a relatively rare opportunity to undertake masters level academic research while gaining practical experience and advanced training in heritage sector roles.
I met a wide-range of people from professionally and academically different backgrounds, who ultimately gave me the confidence to pursue my interests and to think outside the box of what a career in heritage could be.

Immerse yourself in Derbyshire’s history
Where better to study public history and heritage than Derbyshire? From fine aristocratic estates to the archaeology of the Industrial Revolution, our county encapsulates many aspects of England’s historical experience.
Heritage attractions such as museums, galleries and country houses are key to our city and county’s appeal, with annual visitor numbers reaching almost 40 million.
As part of your studies, you will explore a range of heritage sites with global significance. These include the UNESCO-recognised Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site which lies only minutes away from our Derby campus, and various National Trust and English Heritage properties.
Strong industry partnerships
Our flourishing links with the heritage, creative and cultural industries will open doors for you. The course gives you access to producers of public history and heritage, such as local authorities, charitable trusts, businesses, community groups and private individuals. You will therefore gain unrivalled experience of the different practical, legal, commercial and management challenges facing the sector today.
Our partnerships span organisations with international profiles. As well as Derwent Valley Mills, they include Derby Museums Trust, which incorporates the Derby Silk Mill, site of the world’s first factory now being redeveloped as a ‘Museum of Making’.  The Trust also holds landmark works by Joseph Wright of Derby, designated by Arts Council England as a collection of national importance.
Real-world learning in action
You’ll undertake a work-based consultancies in a public history or heritage-related organisation, go on frequent field trips and undertake employer-led projects.
Employability skills are embedded in every aspect of the course, so you will benefit from practical training in areas such as heritage management, audience research, policy writing, fundraising, curation – including digital curation – marketing and communication.
At the same time, you will explore advanced academic and conceptual debates around public history and heritage. The MA culminates in a research-based dissertation on a relevant theme of your choice.
Projects to bring the past to life
There is the chance for you to undertake wide-ranging projects on behalf of arts and heritage organisations. You will work to ‘live briefs’ set by employers which reflect current opportunities and pressures within the sector.
Among latest initiatives, our students have been designing exhibits charting the history of Derbyshire County Cricket Club and transforming the visitor experience at Derby Silk Mill as part of the international ‘Museomix’ event.
In other enterprising collaborations, students are working in partnership with Derbyshire County Record Office to encourage young people to take a greater interest in archives and with the National Brewery Centre in Burton to chronicle the history of brewing.
Learn from the experts
You will be taught by a team of academic historians and heritage industry experts who can share cutting-edge practice in their fields. They include renowned researchers and authors, who work regularly as consultants on restoration projects and major exhibitions.
The MA opens up wide-ranging opportunities for you to network with heritage professionals inside and outside the classroom – not only on work placements but also through our exciting programme of field visits, guest speakers, conferences and public events.

What you will study
Alongside a dissertation and a work placement, you will study modules such as:
The Politics of History
This module examines how history is used, contested and represented in contemporary society. Using local, national and international case studies, students will consider the philosophical, ethical and methodological issues that arise when historians intervene in public debate.
Current Debates in Global Heritage
You will explore recent growth in the heritage industries, putting regional and national development into a global context. This module will identify current issues and developments in heritage practice and consider what impact this has had on popular understandings of the past.
Curation and Conservation in the Digital Age
This module will consider what skills are needed to conserve, manage and display collections and built heritage. It will explore how the role of curator has changed in the recent past and will equip students with practical skills (both analogue and digital) for a job as a modern curator.
Understanding Audiences and Audience Development
You will examine what audience research, audience development and evaluation mean in the heritage and cultural industries and why these are important. This module will also explore how working more closely with audiences has redefined the role of heritage organisations through the concept of ‘co-production’.
Funding, Marketing and Heritage Management
We will look at the financial, legal and commercial context in which heritage practitioners work and how they manage challenges and constraints. This module will cover the varied management structures of producers of public history and heritage - local authorities, charitable trusts, businesses and private individuals – and help you develop the skills to navigate these as a heritage professional.
Please note that our modules are subject to change - we review the content of our courses regularly, making changes where necessary to improve your experience and graduate prospects.
How you will learn
You will learn through seminars, self-directed study, tutorials, field visits, practical workshops, conferences/guest lectures, and work-based learning.
How you'll be assessed
Assessments will help you develop a wide range of research, critical thinking and presentational skills which are flexible and adaptable for a varied global market.
For instance, in the Politics of History module, you will produce a ‘policy paper’ to present historical research in a format suitable to inform policy makers. Meanwhile, the Understanding Audiences and Audience Development module involves conducting audience research and evaluating actual data, working within a real heritage setting.
