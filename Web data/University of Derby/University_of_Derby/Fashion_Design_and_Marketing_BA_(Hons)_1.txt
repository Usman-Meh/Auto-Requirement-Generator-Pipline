Fashion & Textiles, Guardian University Guide 2025
This course will help you develop fashion design skills, and expand your knowledge of key business aspects through a combination of creative and practical study.
The core purpose of fashion marketing is to supply, disseminate and manage information regarding a brand, company or individual to the public and press.
The course is for anyone wishing to be both creative and strategic. It will help you develop fashion design skills, and expand your knowledge of key business aspects through a combination of creative and practical study.
It is designed for those who want to learn about the business of fashion but have a desire to design and make. Ultimately, this course is for anyone wishing to pursue a fashion marketing career.
You'll gain a valuable insight into the commercial elements of the fashion sector, from an integrated perspective encapsulating emerging fashion design and marketing concepts. This new programme of study incorporates expertise from the BA (Hons) Fashion Design programme, creating an integrated programme of study encouraging 'bespoke' approaches to personal study.
In year one you’ll be introduced to the fundamentals of fashion design practice and market sensing, for the ready-to-wear market. In year two there is a greater emphasis on the commercial world, with a focus on branding and influencing. You will also be encouraged to participate in national and international competitions – several of our recent students have won national competitions over the past few years. Year three provides a unique opportunity for you to advance your thinking and practice, through a self-managed process of risk taking, experimentation and resolution. Modules dedicated to business and entrepreneurship correctly position these activities with a commercial context.
We encourage all second years to take a work placement in industry, which will also give you an additional qualification - the Diploma in Professional Practice. Placements are sometimes hard work but give you fantastic experience and are deeply rewarding. We have previously had students placed at a wide variety of companies including, Marks & Spencer, Temperley London, Erdem, Mother of Pearl, Preen, Aitor Throup, Tommy Hilfiger and Roksanda, amongst others.
Students applying from one of the University of Derby's Partner Schools or Colleges are guaranteed a place or interview, if students meet the minimum entry criteria for their chosen course and apply by the January deadline date.

A viewing of ERDEM 'Imaginary Conversations'
In 2024, Fashion students visited Chatsworth House to view the ERDEM Exhibition
'Imaginary Conversations'
.
This exhibition celebrated the image and legacy of the late dowager Duchess Deborah Devonshire and the Devonshire Collections through the Spring Summer 2024 collection of fashion designer Erdem Moralioĝlu MBE. Students were given an insight into the craftsmanship and tools used to create the collection which translated Duchess Deborah Devonshire's legacy into contemporary fashion. Find out more about
student and graduate
opportunities
through the University of Derby's strategic partnership, which includes The Chatsworth House Trust.
"My favourite part of the exhibition was the insight given into Erdem's narrative development that ran in alignment to creating his garments. It was really interesting to see how he applied rather personal features of Duchess Deborah's life to the garments themselves. I could see the cohesion between each piece but also feel the emotion drilled into the designs. I also loved the experience of seeing the garments and fabric selections in person. I look forward to printmaking due to my love of painting and hopes of applying this to fashion, and Erdem has modelled how that is possible. Along with other textual details like the embroidery and brooches which emanate a sense of attention to detail. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the exhibition and found it very insightful to the role of fashion designer."

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
