Foundation Year - helping you to achieve more
Including a foundation year as part of your four-year study programme will give you a head start in your academic and professional life. The foundation year offers the chance to strengthen your skills, knowledge and confidence – with extensive support from our expert staff – before you advance to stage one of your honours degree. It could also be beneficial if you are planning a career change and want to get to grips with aspects of subjects which are new to you.
Our degrees with a foundation year are continuous, meaning that you won’t need to apply again once you have successfully completed the first year.
Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sport at Derby
This course is ideal for those wishing to pursue careers in teaching PE and similar topics at both primary and secondary level, or who are interested in sport coaching as a form of education. It also prepares graduates for a range of careers related to the delivery of physical activity and PE in a range of settings with diverse audiences. The programme will also suitably skill those wishing to deliver Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sport (PEPAS) in community-based settings.
You’ll join a course that will not only give you a well-rounded approach to teaching but will develop your knowledge in areas like personal, social and emotional skills, psychological wellbeing, transferable educational-focused abilities and physical development.
The course has been developed with input from industry-based practitioners and organisations, so you can guarantee that you’ll graduate with the relevant skills that employers are looking for. You will be supported in enhancing your ability to not only understand the techniques, content and integration of the delivery of PE within the national curriculum, but also a wide range of personal development skills and knowledge, so you will be in a position to “teach the learner, not the subject”.
The course also has a strong focus on the importance of inclusion at both an organisational level and society in general. You will gain an understanding of the additional support needs that you’ll likely to encounter in various PEPAS roles. Aligned with this, you’ll also build an understanding in a number of SEND (special educational needs and disabilities) areas, ensuring you graduate with the skills to recognise and make adjustments for a number of neurodiversity characteristics commonly encountered in both mainstream and specialist population PEPAS delivery.
You’ll also explore the importance of the use of the outdoors as an educational tool and get hands on experience in designing a range of experiences within the natural environment.  This will equip you with a unique skillset that will differentiate your abilities from many other graduates in the marketplace.
Apply theory to practical settings
Throughout the course, you’ll have the opportunity to experience a variety of practical PEPAS delivery settings, giving you the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to enhance your development by undertaking internships and work placements. We have strong links with sports clubs, schools, colleges, community organisations and local authorities to help you deepen your understanding of the educational aspects of sport and the variety of career roles you could pursue. You’ll get involved in delivering sport sessions to groups of different ages and abilities.
You’ll also go on fieldtrips to explore concepts and apply what you’ve been taught in the classroom to real-world settings, as well as engaging with our extensive professional networks, including opportunities for coaching practice and industry-backed research.
Expert teaching
Many of our staff are actively involved in research, undertaking influential studies that are breaking new ground in their disciplines. You'll benefit from teaching by experts in education and sport and enlightening guest lecturers by professional coaches, elite athletes and many more leaders in the field. Below is a brief introduction to a number of the core teaching staff on the Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sport degree programme.
Dr Stuart Mourton
- Stuart is the Programme Leader for BA (Hons) Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sport. He joined the University of Derby in 2013 and has led a number of the degree programmes at Derby, teaches on modules at both undergraduate and postgraduate level, and is a supervisor on a number of PhD supervisory packages. He specialises in the areas of skill acquisition and the development of motor skills across both typically developing populations and individuals with additional support needs. Outside of work, he volunteers with Special Olympics GB, helping develop skiers at the Special Olympics West Midlands ski group.
Nicola Taylor
- Nicola started her teaching experience delivering o
utdoor vocational qualifications to potential outdoor leaders, working with the local schools and special needs groups. She was also a freelance Mountain Instructor teaching climbing, mountaineering and movement skills. She then moved to the University of Derby and now supports the Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sport course.
Dr Niamh Mourton - Niamh is an Associate Lecturer for Physical Education, Physical Activity and Sport and specialises in inclusion. She is the global lead for the Motor Activities Training Programme (MATP) for Special Olympics International and brings extensive experience in areas including inclusive practice, regional/national/global programme design/monitoring/evaluation and also brings extensive knowledge from roles with Youth Sport Trust, The FA and UNESCO.
Teaching staff from the School of Sport and Exercise will also deliver on modules across the degree programme, and each of these will bring relevant applied and research experience to these modules, ensuring specialist staff deliver passionately and with detailed knowledge in all study areas.
Specialist facilities
You can take full advantage of the facilities at our sports centre, which boasts a main hall, fitness gym, studios, squash and badminton courts, an internal climbing wall, sprint track, changing rooms, treatment rooms and a café.
Our substantial investment in sport has also seen the introduction of bespoke equipment and state-of-the-art laboratories to keep our sports students at the forefront of new developments in testing and measuring the parameters of health and fitness. You will advance your skills in our high-specification sport and exercise and biomechanics laboratory. You will also become adept in using a range of computer software packages for statistical and movement analysis.
Our Performance Suite
Our Performance Suite allows Sport and Exercise Science students to learn about performance analysis, biomechanics, strength and conditioning, and injury prevention. As well as elite athletes outside of the University, you'll also be working with our Team Derby athletes to help them improve their performance and successfully compete. Take a look at the Performance Suite and Vicon cameras in action:

Skills to take you far
Beyond the core content of your degree, we help you develop important transferable skills and intellectual abilities that will take you far.
You could take part in additional training to add further professional qualifications to your CV, including coaching badges and other awards given by the national governing bodies for specific sports.
The
Association for Physical Education
is the recognised subject association for Physical Education in the UK. We have embedded their Level 3 diploma in supporting the delivery of PEPAS into our programme, providing students the chance to gain an industry recognised additional qualification as part of their studies.
If you are also interested in further study to postgraduate level, particularly on a Postgraduate Certificate of Education (PGCE) to enable you to enter the teaching profession with qualified teacher status, we will help you prepare for this. You will gain experience of academic research, conduct an independent investigation into a topic of your choice, and take part in university conferences.
Providing applied experience in numerous formats is a central component to the development of highly skilled practitioners. The images below showcase a fieldtrip to Pembrokeshire that our third year students went on. The trip included a range of exciting activities including surfing, axe throwing, camping, hiking and outdoor survival skills. These experiences mirror those offered on residential trips to secondary schools and are designed to enhance a range of personal skills in the students who attend them. On this trip, students engage in and reflect on the activities they will ask their students to undertake in the future, develop an understanding of the challenges and rewards these trips offer, and link their experience to academic research in the area to critically discuss the trip and it’s benefits to them personally, and those who undertake similar experiences.
Sports Scholarships
The University of Derby is a sporting hub for talented athletes and coaches. We have a track record of improving the performance of our
University sports clubs
and we have created an infrastructure to provide support for talented athletes. We offer a
Sports Scholarship
programme that aims to help talented student-athletes realise their sporting potential while supporting them through their academic studies. We offer scholarships of up to £6,000 and provide tailored athlete-support packages delivered by an experienced multi-disciplinary Performance Sport team.
Join Team Derby
If you enjoy a challenge and would like to make the most of your own sporting passion and prowess, you could become involved with
Team Derby
which is the focal point for the University’s sporting community. It encompasses all aspects of sport, including courses, numerous sports clubs, the Athletics Union and sport development activities. You can also take part in the national
BUCS (British Universities and Colleges Sport)
competitions.
We have also recently appointed Double Olympic Medallist, Bryan Steel, as the Head Coach for Team Derby Performance Sport Cycling. Bryan is a celebrated figure in the world of cycling, bringing a wealth of experience to his role. The decorated Olympian, who represented Team GB at four Olympic Games from 1992 to 2004, boasts an impressive medal collection. His crowning achievements include a bronze medal in the team pursuit event at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and a silver medal at the 2004 Athens Games in the same discipline. Brian's journey also includes 14 World Championship appearances, where he secured five medals, along with three medals at the Commonwealth Games. With the arrival of Bryan, Performance Sport at the university will work in partnership with HUUB-BCC Race Team to give track and road riders access to an elite pathway during and post higher education. This collaboration opens doors for Team Derby Performance Cycling's athletes, offering a unique opportunity to bridge their academic pursuits with professional cycling aspirations.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.

Careers
The course is designed to prepare students to progress either straight into roles associated with community physical activity design and delivery, the support and delivery of PE and school sport within an educational environment, or to continue onto further study. The later route would likely involve progressing onto any of the routes to gaining a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE)with qualified teacher status (QTS), that would result in students undertaking teaching roles specialising in PE delivery at all education levels; primary, secondary and/or further education. For those leaners interested in pursuing a career in teaching PEPAS in schools and education establishments in general, the programme has been revalidated in collaboration with the College of Education at the University of Derby to ensure there are multiple progression options for you (both locally and across the UK at other institutions).  There are multiple progression routes for trainee teachers at the University of Derby, including our
PGCE Primary
and
PGCE Secondary (School Direct) with Qualified Teacher Status
, both of which are based at the Derby Campus. Entry to these courses is subject to you meeting initial teacher training entry requirements.
Career opportunities also include physical activity co-ordination, sport and health development officers, fitness and recreation management and health promotion. You could also consider roles in broader areas such as physical activity co-ordination, sport and health development, fitness and recreation management, and health promotion – all areas where there is a strong demand for talented and forward-thinking new recruits.
For students who wish to pursue a career in sport coaching this programme acts as a gateway to roles in this industry, whilst there are also opportunities to progress on to the Masters offer within the School of Sport and Exercise or a PhD within a relevant discipline.
If you want to take your academic knowledge of sport to the next level, this degree acts as a gateway to postgraduate education, with opportunities for you to progress to masters level courses such as our
MSc Applied Sport and Exercise Science
and
MSc Clinical Exercise Science
programmes.
