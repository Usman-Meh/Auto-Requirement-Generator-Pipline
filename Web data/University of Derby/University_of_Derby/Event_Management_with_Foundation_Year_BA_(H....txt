Foundation Year - helping you to achieve more
Including a foundation year as part of your four-year study programme will give you a head start in your academic and professional life. The foundation year offers the chance to strengthen your skills, knowledge and confidence – with extensive support from our expert staff – before you advance to stage one of your honours degree. It could also be beneficial if you are planning a career change and want to get to grips with aspects of subjects which are new to you.
Our degrees with a foundation year are continuous, meaning that you won’t need to apply again once you have successfully completed the first year.
The highlights
You'll learn how to stage events and so much more: we also give you the management, leadership and entrepreneurial skills needed to excel in the events industry, a rapidly evolving sector that needs reshaping and rebuilding after the Covid pandemic
You'll learn how events, tourism and hospitality overlap to make up the wider 'visitor economy', and work closely with Tourism and Hospitality students - this will broaden your career options
You can study abroad for a semester in stage two, and take a placement year before stage three
All modules align with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, so you will learn to think about the social and environmental impact of events, not just the financial gains.
Designed for 2023 and beyond
This  BA (Hons) Event Management degree is designed to give you the management and operational skills needed to succeed in the 2020s and beyond. We have a track record of running successful event management degrees, which regularly gained satisfaction ratings of over 90%, and now we've updated our curriculum to be even more relevant to the industry today.
In particular, we've included more content about business management, entrepreneurship, sustainability, creativity and design thinking, so you graduate as a modern, adaptable and creative thinker who is not afraid to challenge the status quo and lead on change.
We've also redesigned the modules so that instead of studying specific modules in Finance, Marketing, HR and the other business disciplines, we teach these subjects throughout the course at points where they are most relevant. For instance, you will build your financial knowledge as you learn to create business plans, and you will develop HR and leadership skills as you learn how to change and transform an organisation.
Events and the visitor economy
This programme is part of our Centre for Contemporary Hospitality and Tourism, which has been awarded the prestigious
International Centre of Excellence (ICE) in Tourism and Hospitality accreditation
. The course shares key generic modules with our International Tourism Management and International Hospitality Management degrees, so you can appreciate how these three specialisms work together to make up the 'visitor economy' (the services and experiences that attract visitors to a destination.)
You will still focus on events - through activities, assessments and specialist modules - but you'll also develop broader business management knowledge and get the chance to take optional modules in tourism and hospitality subjects. It means you'll have a wider skillset when you graduate and a greater choice of career paths and postgraduate courses.
New Derby Business School in the city centre
We're building a new Derby Business School, serving as an international centre of excellence. The superb new teaching facilities will build on our established reputation for inspirational teaching and research excellence, as we shape the next generation of qualified business leaders.

Practical projects and real events
Throughout the course, you'll be asked to complete a wide range of tasks and activities that an events professional might do, so you build up practical experience and can apply what you're learning.
For example, you'll design, plan and manage virtual, in-person or 'hybrid' events, and learn how to use the latest event technology such as live streaming, surround sound, apps and virtual reality. You'll also get the chance to create promotional videos or brochures for an event, plan and pitch new business proposals, carry out market research and customer satisfaction surveys, produce event safety plans, write bid documents, and evaluate the outcomes of an event.
Derby city and its surroundings are home to many major events venues including Derby Arena, Pride Park Stadium, Derby Conference Centre, Donnington Park and The Roundhouse. Derbyshire also plays host to well-known festivals such as
Y Not
and
Download
. We'll be drawing on our links with events venues and operators in the region, to give you exciting project and networking opportunities. For example, in the past our Event Management students have worked at the Y Not festival, comic book convention Comic Con, and other events for companies like Avant Homes and Peak District Artisans.
Key areas of learning
With this degree, you'll cover the full range of modern-day event management and business management skills. You'll learn to problem-solve and adapt to changing external environments, create successful experiences while considering sustainability, and plan, manage and evaluate projects.
We'll teach you how to research, analyse and present data, as well as how to launch a new business, manage finances and lead teams. You'll also gain vital knowledge about event safety legislation and learn how to assess risk, manage crowds and ensure adequate security is in place.
You'll graduate with a diverse skillset, a 'can-do' attitude and the knowledge and confidence to go out and make your mark in the events industry.
Studying abroad
In stage two of this course, you will get the opportunity to study abroad. You'll be able to choose from a range of countries, such as the Netherlands, Germany, Thailand, Bali and South Africa. It's a great way to experience a different culture, gain a new perspective on your subject, and have an adventure!
Work placements and internships
We'll encourage and support you to take work placements and internships, at home or abroad. In stage two, you must complete at least 30 hours of work experience and then between stages two and three, you can take an optional placement year or a summer internship. This is a valuable opportunity to gain experience and develop your practical skills 'on the job'.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.

Careers
Having learned the latest techniques, processes, and technologies for event management, you'll graduate from this degree as a confident and creative event specialist with strong business acumen. If you want to launch your own business or work for a start-up, you'll have the enterprising attitude and attributes that are needed, including resilience, self-awareness and independent thinking.
Or if you prefer to work for an employer, you'll be well-suited to a range of roles in the event, tourism or hospitality sectors, as well as allied industries such as marketing, PR or HR. You could initially apply for roles such as Conference and Event Co-ordinator, Marketing Executive, Business Development Manager, Communications Co-ordinator, but several years down the line, we think you'll be leading, inspiring and shaping the future of the visitor economy.
