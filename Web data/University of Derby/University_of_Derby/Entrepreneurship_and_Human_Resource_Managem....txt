Develop your knowledge of businesses and people management while pursuing your own areas of interest on a course underpinned by real world business experience.
Our Entrepreneurship modules equip you with broad enterprise and entrepreneurship knowledge which will better enable you to start your own business, act in a freelance capacity or be enterprising within an SME or large company environment.
You’ll study key elements of Human Resource Management which will allow you to contextualise HR policy and practice within discussions surrounding internationalisation, strategic direction and sustainable business.
Real world learning
You’ll apply the theory you learn to real world examples to develop your business knowledge. We’ll use our academic expertise to make the links between theoretical business, enterprise and entrepreneurship frameworks and the practicalities of the real business world. We’ve developed extensive links with the business community, especially through the Derby Network of Entrepreneurs, to enhance the practical focus of this degree.
Take a placement year
You can choose to take a placement year between years two and three of your degree to super-charge your employability and improve your prospects after graduation. We can help you to find a placement and provide support throughout your year away. If that's not for you, you can choose to complete internships during the summer breaks instead.
Choose your pathway
Studying an Entrepreneurship and Human Resource Management Joint Honours degree allows you to choose whether you major in Human Resource Management or study them both equally.
You begin this degree by studying both subjects equally in your first year. By the end of your first year, you will then decide whether you would like to major in Human Resource Management or continue to study them both equally.
BA (Hons) Entrepreneurship and Human Resource Management
In this pathway you study Entrepreneurship and Human Resource Management equally.
BA (Hons) Human Resource Management with Entrepreneurship
In this combination Human Resource Management is the major subject and Entrepreneurship is the minor subject.
What is a Joint Honours degree?
A Joint Honours degree offers students the opportunity to study two subjects.
A Joint Honours degree is a great option if:
You want to study two subjects you’re passionate about
You’ve got a specific career in mind and want to create a tailored degree to prepare you for the future
You want to study a new subject alongside one you’re already familiar with
Big spaces for big ideas
Kedleston Road offers it all: study in our largest library, relax at Basecamp, train in real-world healthcare settings, and stay active in our state-of-the-art Sports Centre.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
