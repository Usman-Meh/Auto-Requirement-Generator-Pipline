The best bits
Combining two subjects boosts your employability and gives you the opportunity to develop knowledge and expertise in two subject areas, making you a more versatile graduate
Explore the broad sweep of British, European and global history from the Renaissance to the twenty-first century and undertake fieldwork at historical locations ranging from country houses to industrial cities
Share your passion for the past by organising and marketing a high-profile public conference where you present your research
Benefit from the support of a dedicated and enthusiastic teaching team who are published experts in their field
Deepen your understanding of education from early years to lifelong learning
Gain a solid understanding of education and educational equality and bring together perspectives from history, psychology, sociology and philosophy
You could not have a better backdrop to your studies of History and Education Studies than Derbyshire. As one of the centres of the British Enlightenment during the eighteenth century, the county has a strong literary heritage and inspired many great writers including Jane Austen, Walter Scott, Charlotte Brontё, George Eliot and Henry James.
Derbyshire is the ideal location to study history - with its rich industrial past and thriving heritage industry, including a UNESCO World Heritage site, we offer study visits and fieldtrips to bring your learning to life. You will explore the practical and intellectual applications of history in museums, art galleries, country houses, parks and heritage sites.
As a History and Education student you will be able to use your ability to analyse literary sources and to interpret the past for the benefit of the wider community. We provide exciting opportunities for projects involving international arts and heritage organisations. Among recent initiatives, our students have worked with Derby Museums in thinking about the communication of the past to a wider public.
Your Education Studies modules will explore the role of education in society and examine how moral and social issues shape learning. You’ll then be able to apply this practically on work placement opportunities throughout your studies.
Putting theory into practice
You’ll benefit from varied teaching approaches, including guest speakers from a range of industry backgrounds, real-world learning opportunities such as live briefs, and projects set by industry, so you’ll graduate with a wealth of experience.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
