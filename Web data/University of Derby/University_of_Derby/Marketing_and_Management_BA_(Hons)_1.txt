As well as developing specialist marketing knowledge, this course explores management subjects, including purchasing, managing international supply chains, lean systems, cost reduction and how to manage people. This ensures you will graduate with the skills and knowledge to work in a range of strategic roles.
Combine your knowledge of fundamental marketing tactics with an applied awareness of company assets, finance and data. You’ll critically apply skills and techniques to oversee varying management situations as well as exploring both the marketing and logistics functions within organisations. You can tailor your degree to your areas of interest through a range of optional modules covering themes such as corporate IT, social media, content, brand and sustainability. We equip you with the knowledge, confidence and creativity to shape an organisation’s marketing, logistics and purchasing strategy.
Choose your pathway
All our Marketing degrees have a common first year. After that, you can continue on your chosen pathway, choose our general BA (Hons) Marketing or you can choose one of our other specialist pathways:
BA (Hons) Marketing, PR and Advertising
BSc (Hons) Digital Marketing
BSc (Hons) Marketing and Consumer Psychology
BSc (Hons) Marketing and Data Insights
The Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) is the leading professional body for marketers worldwide and exists to develop the marketing profession, maintain professional standards and improve the skills of marketing practitioners.
We have joined forces with CIM to give students the opportunity to gain professional qualifications. These qualifications are highly sought after by employers, and their content is reflected in our own degrees. This ensures we are equipping students with the best opportunities for a successful marketing career.

TV commercials. Many of these will be for real company briefs
Visits to exhibitions, trade fairs and companies
Placements and internships
Research projects
How you are assessed
You will be assessed through coursework, which will incorporate individual assignments as well as group tasks. These focus on applying what you have learned to real business scenarios and producing the kind of work that might be expected in a marketing role, for example:

Creative outputs such as infographics, short advertisements, films, blogs, podcasts or bespoke projects and pitches for clients

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
