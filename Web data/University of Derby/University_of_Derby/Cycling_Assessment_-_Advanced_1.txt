Course description
If you’re serious about your cycling, take the next step to optimising your performance with our advanced package. Any level of athlete can benefit from our comprehensive assessment of cycling. You get all the benefits of the experience package with body composition, resting bloods and training zones calculated, but with this package we go further. Additional measurements of cycling efficiency including fat max, along with modern performance measures of critical power and anaerobic work capacity as used by Pro teams will also be included.
Learning outcomes
What's involved?
This package includes the following battery of tests:
Body composition assessment
Resting blood analysis – Haematocrit & Haemoglobin
Blood lactate assessment
This is undertaken through a step protocol where the required power output is gradually increased in 3 minute stages. Capillary blood samples will be measured after each stage to identify LT1 and LT2. This test usually lasts for around 20-30 minutes
Assessment of cycling efficiency
We will calculate your gross efficiency and fat max using advanced gas analysis, this is vital when it comes to calculating fuel use for longer
events
Measures of critical power (a more accurate FTP) and anaerobic work capacity (the battery of energy above critical power)
Critical power and anaerobic work capacity will be calculated using a 3 minute all-out maximal test. This test will also provide us with measures of max power and VO

max / peak
