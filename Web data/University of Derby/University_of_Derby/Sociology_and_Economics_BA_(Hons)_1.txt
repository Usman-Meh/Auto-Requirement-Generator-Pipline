How can we promote social justice in business, politics and the public sector? On this degree you’ll explore key sociological themes underpinned by applied economic theory, perspectives and approaches to prepare you for a range of graduate careers.
Sociology is concerned with how people interact in a diverse range of settings and how the dynamics of these settings are affected by several interacting factors – you’ll explore these dynamics to help develop the skills, insights and ambition to not just understand the complexity of modern societies but to intervene in them and make a positive difference in the lives of others.
Through our Economics modules you’ll develop skills in applying economic theory, perspectives and approaches as a method of solving business and organisational problems. You’ll develop knowledge and capabilities in applied economic analysis and learn to use the software used by leading professionals in the financial sector.
Skills for your future
We’ll provide you with the knowledge and skills required to undertake the type of applied micro and macro-economic analysis needed from business, public and voluntary sector economists. You will develop both quantitative and qualitative analytical skills essential for entry into graduate management and financial training positions, as well as being prepared for progression to postgraduate Economics degrees for a career as an economist.
Sociology is based on the study of people in society, therefore the skills and knowledge you develop within the programme are relevant to a wide variety of careers. It involves study of the behaviour of people in groups and of the relationship between these groups. This balance of studying major issues of concern for society and linking this to academic concepts and theories develops important skills personally and socially, giving you critical analysis skills that can be useful to a range of different industries.
Put theory into practice
You’ll benefit from varied teaching approaches, including guest speakers from a range of industry backgrounds, real-world learning opportunities such as live briefs, and projects set by industry, so you’ll graduate with a wealth of experience.
You can choose to take a placement year between years two and three of your degree to put your skills into practice and gain valuable work experience before you graduate.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
