As a Sociology student, you’ll take critical insight of a traditional academic subject and apply it to life as it is lived today and the forces that shape our lives. You’ll explore inequalities, power, and pressing social problems. You’ll develop the skills, insight and ambition to not just understand the complexities of modern societies but to intervene in them and make a positive difference to the life of others. The world we live is changing rapidly and sociology is a dynamic and evolving subject t best placed to plot global change and how this impacts nations, communities and individuals. Sociology is the study of us – of how we live and how we might.
You’ll combine this with studying History in a city and county with a strong historical heritage – Derby and Derbyshire have always been an important centre for trade, religious expression, industry and enlightenment thought. Our History courses explore these key ideas and themes both within our region and across the globe. You’ll study an exciting range of modules that consider society, culture, politics and economics from the sixteenth century to the modern day.
A global perspective
You can enhance your knowledge through work placements, community engagement, an active student society, and fascinating guest speakers and relevant study visits we will give you an environment in which to understand the many applications of your subjects. Additionally, you can enrich your perspectives and broaden your horizons by taking up the opportunity to spend a semester studying abroad.

Academic expertise
Our Sociology courses are taught by a team that includes experienced researchers whose work is shedding new light on some of the most pressing issues facing our society.
They are recognised for their expertise in research areas such as social policy, childhood and war, extremism and counter terrorism, conspiracy theory, politics and social movements, postcolonialism and globalisation, Marxism, feminism, and social theory. They regularly publish their research findings, deliver conference papers internationally, and contribute to local, national, and international media.
As a Sociology student, you can take part in regular guest lectures and departmental research seminars delivered by leading professionals and eminent academics from other institutions.
Our History teaching is underpinned by active research and scholarship. Your tutors continue to develop their expertise through research, leading to conference papers and the publication of books and articles. This enables us to support you in your development as a student researcher, and for you to develop the confidence to share your own research with others

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
