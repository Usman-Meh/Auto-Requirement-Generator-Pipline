Our Economics courses enable you to develop skills in applying economic theory, perspectives and approaches as a method of solving business and organisational problems. You’ll develop knowledge and capabilities in applied economic analysis and learn to use the software used by leading professionals in the financial sector.
You will combine this with studying history against the rich historical background of Derby and Derbyshire – an important centre for trade, religious expression, industry and enlightenment thought. Our History courses explore these key ideas and themes both within our region and across the globe. You’ll study an exciting range of modules branching from the sixteenth century to the modern day.
Developing your skills
We’ll provide you with the knowledge and skills required to undertake the type of applied micro and macro-economic analysis needed from business, public and voluntary sector economists. You will develop both quantitative and qualitative analytical skills essential for entry into graduate management and financial training positions, as well as being prepared for progression to postgraduate Economics degrees for careers as economists.
Our History courses aim to develop your verbal and written communication skills, team working, and the ability to understand, analyse, and summarise various types of data. These skills not only benefit your study of History, but also enhance your employability upon graduating.

You’ll benefit from varied teaching approaches, including guest speakers from a range of industry backgrounds, real-world learning opportunities such as live briefs, and projects set by industry, so you’ll graduate with a wealth of experience.
You can choose to take a placement year between years two and three of your degree, which would super-charge your employability and improve your prospects after graduation.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.

Careers
Due to the transferable nature of the skills you’ll learn studying History such as verbal and written communication, critical analysis, independent thought and problem solving, you'll be suitably positioned for a range of roles upon graduating. In recent years, our own graduates have entered into a variety of careers, including:
Teaching
Libraries
Museums and archives
Retail and commercial management
Human resources
Marketing
An Economics degree adds prestige to your CV and could be your stepping stone to a lucrative graduate training scheme or a well-rewarded financial consultancy role. Economics graduates with an understanding of business and leadership are in great demand across the public, private and voluntary sectors worldwide. As well as roles in international business, consultancy and finance, you could pursue opportunities in government departments, development agencies, charities and not-for-profit organisations.
Our focus on problem-solving and practical economic analysis extends your career scope further still, opening doors to a much broader range of opportunities than with a more conventional Economics qualification. Some graduates go on to follow careers in areas such as HR, marketing, PR and sales.
