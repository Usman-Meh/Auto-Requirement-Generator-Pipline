Cyber security is now recognised as one of the top global risks, with hacking, malicious code and data theft among some of the reasons why it is vital in the design, development, and implementation of IT systems. This is particularly important as internet users increase exponentially in emerging economies, more data is created and collected than ever before, and businesses find themselves increasingly reliant on online services, and in need of a strong cyber security culture.
This course is accredited by the Chartered Institute of Information Security (CIISec). The course is classed as industry standard and will give you several opportunities to enhance your experience as a cyber security student
Build your understanding of the managerial and technical elements of information security, as well as enterprise-level security
Choose a course designed in consultation with industry to ensure it delivers all the skills needed for the workplace
Enhance your employability and career prospects by preparing for the BSI ISO 27001 lead auditor certifications which are highly sought after by employers
Study innovative techniques being developed through the latest research at the cutting edge of cyber security
Learn how to take a strategic and holistic approach to protect an organisation's systems
Be inspired by a teaching team offering a blend of industry experience and strong academic credentials
Our MSc Cyber Security has been developed to teach you the very latest in information protection techniques, all delivered by academics at the leading edge of research into system penetration and intrusion analysis.

Building a more secure digital society
The speed with which the internet and information sharing has developed has exceeded the pace of secure infrastructure development. Our MSc Cyber Security is designed to help bridge this gap and meet the accelerating demand for professionals with proven information security expertise.
The course prepares students for a management role within organisations to be able to put in place and give continuance to the security profile of the company. This is particularly important in light of the national Cyber Security Strategy and the current shortage of related skills.
A powerful set of skills
Along with exploring established techniques, we cover the innovative practices which are emerging as a result of the very latest research. You will learn about both the managerial and technical elements of information security, as well as enterprise level security. This includes risk management and compliance, together with issues such as securing networks and system penetration testing.
You will hone a wide range of technical skills that can be applied to protect against specific system breaches. You will also learn how to perform ethical hacking: by understanding many of the techniques employed by malicious hackers, you can mitigate risks and thwart potential attacks.
In addition, the MSc equips you with the skills needed to make vital managerial decisions related to protecting an organisation’s security holistically.
Accreditation
Our MSc Cyber Security course has been accredited as industry standard by the Chartered Institute of Information Security (CIISec). Our partnership with CIISec provides a link between our course and the University with the information security industry. As a student, you will be able to take up individual CIISec membership and have the opportunity to create contacts and develop your network within the cyber security community.

Enterprise Security Management
Management of the security process is a crucial part of successful implementation. On this module, you will look at the fundamental network and security management issues that affect businesses, including the often-conflicting organisational goals that can lead to difficult trade-offs between affordability and effective protection.
Studying Masters Level and Research Methods
You will develop the skills to study at masters level to help you plan and execute a research project. You will also gain an understanding of research design and methodological enquiry.
Security: Attacks and Countermeasures
Through investigation, analysis and creative design, this module will enhance your skills in protecting systems against internal and external threats. You will develop the analytical tools to perform pragmatic and ethical system penetration testing.
Securing Networks
The focus of this module is on protecting a network from external and internal threats. You will cover the different methods of system breach, together with the mechanisms for detecting and protecting against them.
Human and Legal Aspects of Cyber Security
This module gives you an introduction to the legal and human dimensions of cyber security. It first covers the application of legal provisions, with a focus on accountability in computer systems. Secondly, it explores the key concepts for human dimensions of cyber security, leading to an understanding of research practice in designing and running scientific studies.
