Sociology and Social Policy - Guardian University Guide 2024
How are identities constructed through our engagement with media? How do disability, class, ethnicity, gender, religion, nationality, sexuality and other social divisions play key roles in both access to the media and modes of representation within the media?
Study key themes such as political economy, representation, discourse and identity to understand human behaviour through the lens of media and society.
Real-world learning
Practical learning is built into your learning, you will learn how to write for different media platforms, such as journalism, promotional and PR writing, with an emphasis on digital media platforms such as web content writing, blogging and social media.
You’ll
also develop your creativity through the planning, design and creation of media projects, learning essential skills in script or treatment writing, digital video and editing. You will bring Sociology to life through work placements, community engagement, an active student society,
and
fascinating guest speakers and relevant study visits to bring to life the many applications of the subject.
Bringing your subject to life
What makes a Derby Sociologist? You’ll apply sociology to the world around you, visiting local religious centres, taking sociological walking tours of the city, and going on exciting field trips to bring sociology to life nationally or globally. You will not just study in Derby, you will study Derby City
and
the County as well as taking national and international perspectives. It is our classroom and our living laboratory!
Our media modules have a strong focus on understanding the dynamics of the media and communication industries, and you will be encouraged to consider philosophical questions of identity, ethics and responsibility in the context of global citizenship.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
