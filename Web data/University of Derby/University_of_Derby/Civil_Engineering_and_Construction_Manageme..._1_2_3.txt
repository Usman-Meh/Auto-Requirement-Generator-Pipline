This Postgraduate Diploma in Civil Engineering and Construction Management course aims to provide the management skills necessary to address the technological and environmental issues facing the civil engineering and construction industry sectors in the foreseeable future.
The course content investigates and examines the links between legislation, the environment, and the technical innovations required to address contemporary concepts of sustainable urban and rural development of property and infrastructure.
Whether you are working in Civil Engineering or Construction, modules on this course will be highly applicable to your professional field, such as flood risk engineering management, sustainable development, and environmental performance management.
The combination of core and optional modules enables you to tailor your studies to meet your personal and professional interests. Modules address topics important in successfully achieving and maintaining sustainable built environments, – anything ranging from significant property developments to infrastructure projects including highways and railways.
On this course, you will also develop your transferable skills in scholarly writing, research, critical thinking, independent learning, communication and problem-solving. Such skills will mean you are ideally placed to engage with continuing professional development and further advanced study in the disciplines of civil engineering and construction management.
A stepping-stone to a Masters qualification
This Postgraduate Diploma is the second stage of the
Master's (MSc) in Civil Engineering and Construction Management course
, giving you 120 credits at level seven. Upon completing the PG Dip, you may wish to continue your studies by completing the Independent Scholarship (a triple module worth 60 credits), the final stage of the Master's qualification.
You can also study this course, full or part-time, on campus.
Real-world learning with our UK-based residential
As part of the Postgraduate Diploma, you will be required to attend a three-day residential in Derbyshire if you choose the Geomatic Monitoring and Asset Engineering optional module. This will be extended to a five-day block residential week if you also take the Advanced Geotechnical Engineering module which involves laboratory work at our campus.
The residential enables you to apply the skills and knowledge you have acquired in a practical setting, allowing you to gain experience using state-of-the-art equipment found on site. This can be a great opportunity to network and make industry links, meeting others from your course as well as your tutors.

How you will learn
Pace of study
The academic year is made up of three 10-week terms, known as trimesters. We recommend about 20 hours of study per week to complete one 20-credit module over a 10-week trimester for the standard study plan.
If you opt to undertake the accelerated study plan whereby you will study two modules in one trimester, we recommend 40 hours of study per week.
Should you decide to study on the accelerated rate you should ensure that you have the capacity to fully engage with your studies and achieve the best grades and final award. If you choose to study on the accelerated rate, you will need to balance approximately 40 hours of study per week alongside your professional and personal life and commitments.
It may be useful to consider studying one module at the standard rate of study before deciding whether to then increase to the accelerated rate of study.
There will be 1/2 virtual classrooms over the 10 week trimester and if you are unable to attend you will be able to download the session to view in your own time.
Study Skills
Many of our students are mature learners and have not studied academically for many years. To help you to become an effective student, able to study at postgraduate level, there are a number of advanced study skill resources available to you covering areas such as research skills, critical evaluation in an academic context, literature search, referencing, plagiarism and so on.
Assessment method
You will undertake formative and summative assessments to demonstrate that you have met the module and programme learning outcomes.
Formative assessment activities provide the opportunity for structured learning and feedback, such as self-assessment, peer review or feedback directly from your tutor.
More formal summative assessments which count towards your grades, such as project design work and design briefs, project reviews and portfolios, assignments, case studies, presentations, teamwork projects and examinations.
The following three modules involve a time-constrained exam which will be taken online.
Project Planning Value Engineering and Risk Management
Transport and Infrastructure Engineering & Sustainable Design
Advanced Geotechnical Engineering
Theoretical concepts and practical application will be covered in live lectures, tutorials and seminars.
Residential opportunities
Two optional modules, the Geomatic Monitoring and Asset Engineering module and the Advanced Geotechnical Engineering module, incorporate a short residential held in Derbyshire. During the residential, you will undertake practical sessions and assessments to gain hands-on experience of a range of civil engineering processes whilst learning to identify significant logistical and management constraints.
If you select a module involving the residential, you are required to attend at least 75% of the residential to pass the programme.
Details for residential costs can be found in the fees section.
Personal Development Planning (PDP) and Employability
Personal development planning (PDP) is embedded throughout this course. During your studies, you will be encouraged to identify how aspects of the programme will both benefit your development and future practice.
Professional development opportunities exist throughout each module, such as: live projects, industry links and case studies, conferences, professional body CPD courses, proposals, presentations and student delivery of seminar topics.
You will be actively encouraged to adopt a developmental and reflective attitude towards understanding transferable skills and their potential for employment opportunities. To help you reflect on your current competencies, you will have access to reflective self-assessment and personal diagnostic tools and a wealth of resources.
As you set out or develop in your professional career, you will be required to continually develop your skills as technologies can become obsolete or be superseded. At postgraduate level this is effectively the beginning of your PDP or Continuing Professional Development (CPD) journey.
Student support and guidance
Whilst we encourage our students to become independent, life-long learners, we also recognise that offering the right support and guidance will help you to achieve your goals. There is a wealth of support available to you at the University, from your dedicated Personal Tutor and Online Learner Advisor, through to our:
Library
Health and Wellbeing Centre
Careers and Employability Service
IT Support
Union of Students
Develop@Derby
for study, personal and employability skills
All these services, and more, are available to you as an online student at the University of Derby.

About your fees
This figure would be the total cost of this course based on the fee in the current academic year. However, please note that fees normally increase in line with inflation and the University's strategic approach to fees, which is reviewed on an annual basis. The total fee you pay may therefore increase if your course lasts longer than one year.
If you are required to undertake any associate study or additional study as a condition of your offer for the programme, please be aware that the cost for this may be in addition to the programme cost stated above.
Residential costs
The Geomatic Monitoring and Asset Engineering module and the Advanced Geotechnical Engineering module contain a short residential which is taken in during a block week. To undertake the residential, there is an additional cost of £150 which is not included in your course fees.
If you choose to study the Geomatic Monitoring and Asset Engineering module or both the Geomatic Monitoring and Asset Engineering module and the Advanced Geotechnical Engineering module, the total cost of the course is £6,150 (new students in AY24/25) and £6,480 (new students in AY25/26).
The full programme fee quoted does not include the cost of the residential as it depends on your module choices. Please note, if you opt for the residential, you will be responsible for arranging and paying for your own travel, short-term study visa (if required), accommodation and other incurred costs. The University will assist, where possible, with these arrangements.
