Hands-on learning
The BSc (Hons) Economics and Finance is a highly practical applied degree. Every day brings a fresh challenge to broaden your professional outlook. You may find yourself analysing news reports, creating strategy documents, interpreting financial reports, undertaking research tasks, harnessing latest software, delivering presentations, videos and broadcast interviews, tracking your own portfolio of investments, or analysing information from Bloomberg on international markets and organisations.
Employers are closely involved in shaping our degree. They provide real-world case studies, practical scenarios and consultancy projects which will enhance the currency of your studies.
Facilities and resources
At Derby you’ll discover cutting-edge learning resources to help you get to grips with the up-to-the-minute technology and information used by finance professionals across the globe. Our
Financial Markets Lab
has been established in partnership with Bloomberg, the international business and financial information leader, to enrich your learning.
Projects in the lab give you exciting insights into what it is like to work on a trading floor in the financial district. You’ll have access to analysis of current affairs from a wealth of financial data, including company and director profiles from around the world. As part of your degree, you can even work towards the Bloomberg Market Concepts Certificate to add substance to your CV.

Expert teaching
Our teaching team conducts significant research which is influencing current debates about key economic and financial issues. Our lecturers publish widely, including one of the main economics textbooks used in universities.
You’ll also engage with business experts, industry leaders and finance professionals. Our students hear about latest developments in the City from high-profile figures such as our Visiting Professor of Banking and Financial Economics, Professor Trevor Williams, ex-Chief Economist at Lloyds Bank PLC.
You can also immerse yourself in the wider business community – and open up new networks of contacts – by joining one of the University’s societies such as the Economics, Trading and Investment Society, the Business and Entrepreneurial Society and the Derby University Network of Entrepreneurs (DUNE).
Global thinking
International perspectives are important for the aspiring financial experts of the future. Our Economics and Finance team boasts strong links with academic partners in countries such as China and Spain which bring a global dimension to their teaching.
We offer you the chance to study abroad – based with one of our international partner institutions – for a semester or a year, usually in stage two of the course.
Alternatively, you can join one of our optional short study visits abroad. A visit to Copenhagen, for example, saw our students exploring different aspects of fraud investigations.
An extra qualification: the Futures Award
Through our Futures Award scheme, you can showcase your versatility and potential to prospective employers. Reflecting transferable skills, a Futures Award recognises any extra-curricular activities which contribute to your personal and professional development. These could include attending workshops on CV design and improvement; developing techniques for interviews, assessment centres or psychometric tests; taking part in networking events; or leading a small project within a student society or voluntary role.
Big spaces for big ideas
Kedleston Road offers it all: study in our largest library, relax at Basecamp, train in real-world healthcare settings, and stay active in our state-of-the-art Sports Centre.

How you will learn
You will learn through a combination of:
lectures
problem-solving seminars
group work and discussions
workshops
case study analysis
computer lab work
practical analysis
Ours is a friendly and supportive learning community, with small classes where you will receive plenty of one-to-one guidance. At the start of the course you will benefit from substantial direction from our teaching team. As your studies progress, you are expected to work more independently, taking greater responsibility for your own learning.
Additional support is provided through our specially designed personal tutor system. You’ll meet your personal tutor during Induction Week and have at least three scheduled meetings with them each year. They will help you plan your personal and career development as well as supporting your work towards the Futures Award.
We also have a diverse range of guest speakers to inspire our students and share their stories. Recently we had Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus, who delivered a session on ‘The concept of microcredit’ as part of our 2021 Student Lecture Series.
Showcasing your skills
There may be opportunities to take part in national competitions such as the University Trading Challenge, where students pit their wits against each other in trading various financial instruments such as shares, bonds, commodities and foreign exchange. They also present risk strategy case studies before a panel of judges. The University has an excellent track record in this prestigious event, with students winning a series of awards and raising their professional profile.  Other well-known competitions that we’ve previously entered include the IBM University Business Challenge and CIMA Global Business Challenge.
How you are assessed
The majority of modules do not involve exams. Assessments are designed to ensure you can identify issues, decide how to collect and analyse evidence, come to reasoned conclusions based on that evidence, and present your findings via various communication methods.
At Stage 1: Computer-based assessments help you gauge your own level of learning and gain constructive feedback. Some modules involve more traditional essays and reports plus a mixture of individual and group tasks. You are also encouraged to keep a reflective portfolio.
Stage 2: Features further assessments of your individual and group work, report writing and communication skills, including innovative challenges such as a broadcast interview and poster design. Computer, portfolio and report-based assessments will focus on your professional analysis experience including data retrieval and quantitative analytics using financial data.
At Stage 3: Assessments centre on your research and consultancy skills. Through the Applied Economic Project, you will apply these skills to a live project involving a business.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
