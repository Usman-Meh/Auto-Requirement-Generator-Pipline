How do equality, opportunity and social structures shape life today? Explore the human experience through a sociological and literature-based lens to explore questions about who we are, why we are here, and the nature of the world in which we find ourselves.
By examining the past, present and future you’ll see how social and linguistic structures affect interactions of those currently living in society. You’ll learn about social justice, distribution of power, globalisation, self-expression in the modern world and politics of the household. The English programme’s distinctive core of engagement with critical and cultural theory will simultaneously enable you to develop a highly nuanced and sophisticated approach to the analysis of literature, language and culture.
Academic Expertise
You will be taught by experienced researchers whose work is shedding new light on some of the most pressing issues facing our society as well as on a range of cultural topics. They regularly publish articles and books and deliver conference papers internationally.
English academics have specialised knowledge in fields such as Romanticism, blasphemy and censorship, nineteenth-century literature, post-colonial theatre, critical theory and postmodernism. The Sociology team are recognised for their expertise in research areas such as social policy, childhood and war, extremism and counter terrorism, conspiracy theory, humour and society, politics and social movements, Marxism and social theory.
Explore the human experience
English incorporates not only literature, but also the contexts in which literature is produced and read. You’ll examine the intellectual and cultural study of art, film, philosophy, linguistics and sociology within contemporary politics.
Literature asks questions about who we are, why we are here, and the nature of the world in which we find ourselves. We’ll introduce you to a range of cultural expressions from across the globe and from varying historical periods. This will broaden your understanding of the variety of human experiences and how a diverse range of literature seeks to encapsulate it.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
