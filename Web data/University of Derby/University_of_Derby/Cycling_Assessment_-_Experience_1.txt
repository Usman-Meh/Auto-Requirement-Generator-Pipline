Course description
Ever wondered just how good professional cyclists are? Why not book our experience package to find out how you compare to the best in the world?
The laboratory experience package has been designed to provide you with accurate physiological data that can be used to guide your training and ensure you can perform optimally during competition. Data from this package can be used to establish training zones and individualise your training programme. It will also identify your strengths and weaknesses on the bike and establish just how you compare to an elite cyclist.
Learning outcomes
What's involved?
This package includes the following battery of tests:
Body composition assessment using bioelectrical impedance
Resting blood analysis – Haematocrit & Haemoglobin
VO 2 max and blood lactate assessment
This is undertaken through a step protocol where the required power output is gradually increased in 3 minute stages. Capillary blood samples will be measured after each stage to identify LT1 and LT2. This test usually lasts for around 20-30 minutes
Once we have identified clear threshold in the lactate profile the protocol will change to a ramp protocol where the required power output will be gradually increased until you reach exhaustion. This will enable VO
2
max / peak, max HR and max aerobic power to be calculated
Benefits
Following these tests you will be provided with all results, an explanation of what each metric means to you and your cycling, and a comparison to pro athletes. We will also identify some specific training you can do to target each of the metrics.
Fees and funding
£120
