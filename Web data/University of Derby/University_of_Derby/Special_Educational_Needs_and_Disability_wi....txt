Make a difference in your career
We will equip you for a broad range of roles where you can improve the life experiences of individuals with special learning needs. You’ll build the skills and knowledge to support children and adults with diverse needs, such as specific learning difficulties, physical disabilities, behavioural problems and sensory impairments.
You will gain an in-depth understanding of all aspects of SEND. We engage you in discussions and debates, harnessing the latest research to stimulate your thinking and challenge your ideas. You will also explore the possible psychological, sociological, philosophical and biological causes of SEND.
A whole range of professionals – including carers, social workers, special educational needs co-ordinators (SENCOs) and therapists – come together to deliver SEND support. As part of the course, you’ll take a close look at the importance of this multi-agency support and the positive impact it can have on individuals.
A strong focus on real world learning
To ensure that you’re ‘career ready’ when you graduate, you’ll learn a range of practical techniques to support individuals both inside and outside the classroom.
As part of your studies, you’ll undertake two placements which will give you important insights into professional practice. You can choose to be based in settings such as hospitals, schools, social services, adult provision or charitable organisations.
Expertise, influence and inspiration
You will learn from a dedicated and enthusiastic team, including experts in the fields of education, health, psychology and social work. They will share their experiences with you and provide fresh perspectives on the challenges and opportunities of working in SEND.
Our course is underpinned by the latest theories and innovative ideas in SEND and inclusive practices. Our lecturers regularly publish their work and have conducted important studies into a wide range of subjects, such as managing the inclusion of SEND pupils in the classroom.
Raise your professional profile
Throughout the course, your learning will be enriched by our strong professional links. We will introduce you to leading practitioners and our Visiting Professors include notable figures such as Brian Lamb OBE, who chaired a high-profile inquiry into parental confidence in SEND and whose work has influenced major policy changes.
We have launched a Professional Development Network for SEND and Inclusive Practice which brings together practitioners working to ensure positive, effective and inclusive education across the special and mainstream sectors.
By joining this professional community, you can take part in our annual SEND conferences which attract influential guest speakers and spark important debates about how to improve SEND provision.
A vibrant learning experience
We pride ourselves on providing a friendly, welcoming learning environment where you will receive plenty of encouragement and guidance. Our tutors are approachable, dedicated and passionate about their subjects.
You’ll learn in our Kirtley Building which offers first-rate facilities, including specially designed collaborative learning spaces and a large hall for practical activities and observing learning in action.
Build a course that matches your interests
Our choice of optional modules means that you can tailor your studies to reflect your personal interests and career aspirations. These could cover themes such as autism in children and adults, attention disorders, diversity in social, emotional and behavioural development, and diversity in communication, speech and language development.
Following a passion
Every day, Jack Holcombe sets himself a target. And it’s always the same: to bring a sense of energy, excitement and joy to the people around him. They could be his friends or the people he meets through his course or on work experience.

Foundation Year - helping you to achieve more
Including a foundation year as part of your four-year study programme will give you a head start in your academic and professional life. The foundation year offers the chance to strengthen your skills, knowledge and confidence – with extensive support from our expert staff – before you advance to stage one of your honours degree. It could also be beneficial if you are planning a career change and want to get to grips with aspects of subjects which are new to you.
Our degrees with a foundation year are continuous, meaning that you won’t need to apply again once you have successfully completed the first year.
Big spaces for big ideas
Kedleston Road offers it all: study in our largest library, relax at Basecamp, train in real-world healthcare settings, and stay active in our state-of-the-art Sports Centre.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
