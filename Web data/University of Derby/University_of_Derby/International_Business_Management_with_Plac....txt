Globalisation has opened up exciting career prospects for people who understand business from an international, cross-cultural perspective. We’ve designed this new BSc (Hons) International Business Management to help you make the most of those opportunities.
The degree will encourage you to think widely and offers you the chance to study a range of subjects including business management, economics, accounting and finance, marketing, human resource management (HRM), logistics, enterprise, IT and technology. You'll put these skills into practice in industry with a placement between your second and third year.
Events such as Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, and the global economic and financial crisis of 2008-9, have increased interest in many of these subjects. They have shown that it's important to get a complete picture of economic and business problems — both in relation to what causes them, what impact they have and what solutions there might be.
Boost your employability with a placement year
You’ll have the opportunity to take a placement year to put the skills you’ve learned into practice in a real-world environment. We'll support you to find your placement and throughout your year in industry. Placements allow you to gain valuable experience to add to your CV, make industry contacts and help you to narrow down what kind of role you may be interested in after graduation.
New Derby Business School in the city centre
We're building a new Derby Business School, serving as an international centre of excellence. The superb new teaching facilities will build on our established reputation for inspirational teaching and research excellence, as we shape the next generation of qualified business leaders.

Professionally approved
This International Business Management degree is accredited by two professional bodies: the
Chartered Institute of Management Accountants
(CIMA) and the
Chartered Management Institute
(CMI). These are important quality marks, demonstrating that the degree has been independently assessed and judged to be high quality and relevant to a specific industry.
CIMA accreditation means you will gain exemptions towards CIMA's professional accountancy qualifications and enables you to gain CIMA membership faster. Similarly, the CMI accreditation means that once you have successfully completed this degree, you will be eligible for another professional qualification: the CMI Level 5 Award in Management and Leadership.
About the pathways
All students take the same core modules in the first year to gain an important foundation in all aspects of international business management, including micro and macro economics, quantitative analysis, global business and sustainability, human resources, finance and business performance.
After that, you can choose one of our specialist pathways or continue on a general International Business Management route. If you choose a specialist pathway, around a third of your modules in years two and three will be dedicated to your chosen subject.
Whichever pathway you choose, you won't be closing any doors; you will still gain a solid grounding in all of the key areas, such as economics, data analysis, sustainability, project management, finance and business strategy.
Core International Business Management pathway — BSc (Hons) International Business Management
On this route you will develop a broader, rounded skillset but still get the opportunity to explore specialist areas through optional modules in years two and three. These optional modules make up around a third of the course content in the final two years and include various topics from across all pathways, as well as additional subjects such as Marketing and Enterprise.
BSc (Hons) International Business Management (Economics)
If you are most interested in how wealth is produced and distributed, and how people, markets and governments interact, this economics pathway is for you. We will analyse current and historical economic debates and learn what it means to have a sustainable economy — a system that supports long-term economic growth without negatively impacting social, environmental, and cultural aspects of the community.
You will also develop greater financial awareness, including the nature of international financial markets and the array of financial instruments available to investors and firms. We will introduce you to the methods that organisations use to manage the risks of trading in global markets and you'll build up valuable practical skills in risk management strategy.
BSc (Hons) International Business Management (Finance)
Strong financial management is essential to a prosperous international business, and this is a popular route that will further your financial expertise. You'll learn more about how international financial markets operate and develop the specialist skills needed to assess the financial health of an organisation. We'll also ensure you understand the key pillars of personal finance and how to make decisions that meet personal/family goals and maintain a decent standard of living in the long term. This is a valuable life skill and it could also lead you towards a career as a financial advisor or personal financial planner.
In the final year you'll move back to studying finance for businesses, expanding your understanding of investment decision making, investor behaviour and financial markets in crisis. We'll analyse issues like asset bubbles, bank failures and the problems of regulating financial activity in domestic and global markets. You will even get the opportunity to build your own portfolio of investments and analyse its effectiveness and performance.
BSc (Hons) International Business Management (Supply Chain and Logistics)
With logistics skills in high demand and short supply, this combination could make you a highly sought-after employee. Logistics and supply chain management is an important, vibrant and technology-driven industry undergoing massive expansion. Ensuring the right goods get to the right place at the right time and in the right condition is vital to any international organisation, as the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted.
We will cover topics such as the importance of managing a business' assets and creating value from them, how to create and manage sustainable supply chains, the specific principles and practices relevant to international supply chains, and supply chain strategy.
BSc (Hons) International Business Management (Business Technology)
Businesses increasingly rely on technology and IT systems to help them operate effectively and the COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated this trend. On this pathway you can combine your interests in international business management and technology and develop skills which will enable you to forge a career in areas like project management, business analysis or consultancy.
You'll gain broad knowledge of current and future business technology, including different types of database, Enterprise Resource Planning systems (ERPs), intranets and portals, groupware and e-commerce. We'll evaluate various approaches for organising, resourcing and managing the IT/IS function in business organisations and look at the importance of having a coherent IT architecture. You'll learn to design and manage effective relationships with IT suppliers and become skilled in business analysis, so you're able to accurately capture business requirements and evaluate and propose IT-related solutions to business problems.
Practical experience in our Financial Markets Lab
In our impressive
Financial Markets Lab
, you can harness the same information and technology used by financial professionals all over the world. You will be working with the latest data on companies and financial markets, including director profiles, and have access to analysis of current affairs in Bloomberg Intelligence. The lab is also the ideal setting to deepen your understanding of trading floor activities.
Other benefits include training from Bloomberg specialists and access to their helpdesk. You can also work towards the
Bloomberg Market Concepts Certificate
to add to your portfolio of skills.

Studying abroad and overseas trips
In your second year, we encourage you to spend time studying abroad for a semester, so you can see international business from a different perspective. We have a wide range of overseas partners you could study with. If you choose to take up this opportunity, three of your six modules in year two will be replaced by modules at the overseas university. You can also enjoy a taste of international study by joining one of the short visits abroad we usually organise each year.

Building experience and boosting your CV
Our collaborations with regional, national and international employers help you amass up-to-date knowledge and build experience. You will attend insightful guest lectures, learn about real-world case studies and get to work on practical consultancy projects.
Work placements and internships
We also offer you plenty of opportunities to take work placements or internships, at home or abroad. In your second year you must complete at least 30 hours of work experience, and then between years two and three, you can choose to take a placement year or a summer internship. You can draw on our links with professional organisations like PwC, DHL, CPA Australia and the Institute of Directors to compete for international placement opportunities.
We'll help you find the right opportunity to match your career aspirations and interests and during your time in the workplace, one of our tutors will also visit you to monitor your progress.
Get recognition for the extra bits you do
You can choose to work towards our Futures Award in Networking and Awareness in International Business alongside your degree. It's designed to enhance your employability and your CV by formally recognising any extra-curricular career development activities you do. This might include:
attending workshops on CV design and improvement
developing techniques for interviews
preparing for assessment centres or psychometric tests
taking part in networking events, or
leading a small project within a student society or voluntary role.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
