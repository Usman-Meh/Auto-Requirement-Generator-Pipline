Graphic design is seen, felt and experienced everywhere. Once focused on objects, graphic design is now increasingly concerned with contexts. Graphic designers inform, confront, persuade, entertain, provoke, challenge, question, direct and engage with the political, social and environmental issues of the world we live in.
The aim of the graphic design programme is to create passionate, creative, resourceful, entrepreneurial and adaptive problem-finders, who are prepared both technically and intellectually to embrace and exploit the opportunities that graphic design offers in the 21st Century.
Being a graphic designer is fun, stimulating and inspiring. Designers are creative problem-finders and solvers. You will be challenged to think differently, even professional designers are constantly developing their skills. There are always new trends, new technologies, new ideas, and new sources of inspiration – a creative mind never stops learning. It is more than just a job – it's a way of life.
The course is studio based, practical, hands-on and creative. It offers you many different ways to make graphic design work as you explore the different contexts and formats in which graphic design is experienced. It allows you to decide what kind of designer you want to be. It will test and challenge you to expand your understanding and knowledge of what graphic design is, what it can do and what it is for.
You will be introduced to typography and layout, drawing as observation and problem solving, identity and branding, packaging and point of purchase, exhibition design, publication and printing, and digital moving image. The course has a great resource base for you to use. Typically our students work on Apple Macs in computer labs, and in the Digital Print Hub you will be able to access (under guidance) high quality printing on many different types of materials, laser-cutting, book-binding, and other printing options, including screen print and Letterpress print in our Printing Studios.
You'll have the chance to work on live projects and competitions which in the past have included a collaborative project with Derby Museum to make new interpretive tools for their archaeology gallery. Students have also been briefed by the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) at Markeaton Street, for the RSA Student Design Awards. The RSA student briefs tackle social engagement and allow students to explore graphic design solutions for real world issues. And students from graphic design and illustration were shortlisted for the prestigious Penguin Student Design Awards.
We understand how important it is to have the professional skills that you need to make the transition from University to employment. So we have a professional practice module in the second year that is all about researching the industry, meeting designers and studios, building design networks, identifying your strengths and promoting yourself as a graphic designer. This work has helped our students prepare for graduate life, with 93.8% of our students being in graduate level destinations within six months of completing this course (HESA 2016).

How you will learn
Facilities
The Graphic Design studio provides you with an excellent environment to be curious, experimental and independently motivated. It is a location for both individual and group tuition, a creative space for the practice of sharing ideas and peer-learning, exercising creative skills, imagination, vision, innovation and ambition. This environment will be used to explore and undertake group work, peer evaluation, critiques and seminars as a means of complementing more individualistic and autonomous work. You will learn the importance of this creative space and utilise it to build networks, be open to new influences, and become part of a creative community, which encourages you to work both independently and cooperatively.
You'll also have access to workshops the drawing room, printmaking facilities, and the
Digital Design Hub
which is located next to the studio offering you experiences of engaging in finishing techniques from laser cutting, bookbinding, and foiling.
You’ll use high-specification iMacs latest versions of software used by the industry and be able to hire a range of hardware from our
Media Loan Hub
, including Wacom Cintiq tablets, and HD cameras.
Teaching Methods
Teaching
is delivered mainly through studio-based and experiential learning using project briefs. This is supported with tutorials, lectures, seminars, visiting speakers and visits to galleries and exhibitions.
You'll work with both local and national project partners on live project briefs and national competitions. Our students have worked with Derby Museum and Art Gallery, Ernest and Julio Gallo Wineries Europe. They have also responded to competition briefs from D&AD (Designers & Art Directors), Young Creatives Network, Penguin Student Design Awards and the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) Student Design Awards.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
