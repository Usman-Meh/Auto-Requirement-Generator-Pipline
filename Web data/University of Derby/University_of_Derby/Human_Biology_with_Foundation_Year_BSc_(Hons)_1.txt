BSc (Hons) Human Biology - National Student Survey 2024
Human Biology at Derby
If you aspire to a scientific career focused on improving people's health and wellbeing, this degree is an ideal starting point. Studying Human Biology places you at the forefront of advances in areas like medicine, sports science, physiology and mental health.
Ageing is inevitable - but healthy ageing is achievable. With people living longer and the population getting older, effective approaches to healthy ageing have never been more important, as reflected in global initiatives, like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals where 'Good Health and Wellbeing' is highlighted as a priority. By studying with us, you will address some of the most pressing health concerns facing today's society, by investigating the cause, effect and treatment of human disease and illness.
This course delivers a solid grounding in human physiology and anatomy, biochemistry, genetics and medical microbiology, helping you understand the basis of human disease, diagnosis and treatment. You'll also explore factors which impact health such as physical activity, smoking, air pollution, infectious disease, and alcohol/drug misuse, plus the social and economic changes and government policies transforming global public health.
Professional and career development skills are embedded throughout our courses. You'll have the opportunity to visit different health care and laboratory environments, and attend guest lectures from leading professionals.
Foundation Year - helping you to achieve more
Including a foundation year as part of your four-year study programme will give you a head start in your academic and professional life. The foundation year offers the chance to strengthen your skills, knowledge and confidence – with extensive support from our expert staff – before you advance to stage one of your honours degree. It could also be beneficial if you are planning a career change and want to get to grips with aspects of subjects which are new to you.
Our degrees with a foundation year are continuous, meaning that you won’t need to apply again once you have successfully completed the first year.
Expert teaching
You'll benefit from working with lecturers who have a wealth of experience in their chosen profession, so you're getting industry-relevant teaching to help you shine in your chosen career. Many are also involved in research, bringing the latest theories into the classroom.
The diversity of research projects under way is vast – covering issues such as:
The role of the Human Papillomavirus in the development of head and neck cancers
Antibiotic resistance bacteria in healthy individuals
Mechanisms and cardiovascular effects of anti-angiogenic drugs
You could apply to help with the team’s research projects, which will deepen your understanding and give you an ideal preparation for your future career.
"Every one of my lecturers inspired me with their passion for the subject and their desire for students to question them. They want you to do well and helped whenever I asked."
Claire Storer, BSc (Hons) Human Biology graduate
Accredited course
Our accreditation from the
Royal Society of Biology (RSB)
follows an independent and rigorous assessment, ensuring that the degree provides a solid academic foundation in biological knowledge, key technical abilities, and transferrable skills.
This means that, when you graduate, you will meet the requirements for Associate Membership of the Society (AMSB), and after appropriate professional experience you can then apply for full membership, which is widely recognised throughout the industry and by potential employers.

How you will learn
You’ll learn through lectures, seminars, tutorials, and e-learning, supported by hands-on laboratory practicals.
Assessment
No single assessment style suits everyone, so we take a diverse approach across the different modules. You’re assessed using a range of written assignments (including data analysis, portfolios, and practical reports) and computer-based assessments. Coursework includes essays, experimental reports (based on laboratory work), case studies, reflective portfolios, posters and oral presentations. In some modules, group work is assessed.
At Level 6 students are expected to be able to demonstrate their knowledge, understanding, and application of the original work generated within their Research Project by submission of a thesis, and through an oral/poster presentation to a lay audience.
Tailor your degree
You can adapt your studies to suit your chosen career path while gaining a greater understanding of how the body functions. We offer a selection of optional modules in bioscience, sport science and psychology to enable you to focus on areas that interest you most. In your final year, you’ll undertake an in-depth research project into a human health theme which matches your interests and aspirations.
Broaden your perspectives
We’re committed to your professional and career development. Guest speakers will add an extra dimension to your learning experience. We also have a vibrant Human Biology Society, established and run by students, which organises monthly guest lectures by notable academics on topical subjects. The inaugural lecture covered research into the environmental health conditions in the Calais refugee camps.
Personal academic tutoring
Your personal academic tutor will work with you to help you get the most out of your time at university. Having someone to talk to about your academic progress, your university experience and your professional aspirations is hugely valuable. We want you to feel challenged in your studies, stretched but confident to achieve your academic and professional goals.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
