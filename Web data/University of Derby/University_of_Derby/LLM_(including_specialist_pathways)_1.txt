An edge in your career
As a Derby LLM graduate, you will be highly sought after by employers because you can demonstrate a unique specialisation in the areas of law and criminal justice, evidenced by your final dissertation. It gives you a genuine advantage when applying for positions within and beyond the legal sector.
For non-lawyers, a postgraduate qualification in law can also sharpen your commercial awareness so that you can contribute more effectively to operational and strategic management.
The specialist LLM pathways we offer will open doors to exciting careers. You could progress to legal roles in the corporate and financial business sectors; enter legal practice or a research role with a focus on intellectual property or IT law; work in the field of human rights; or take up a post with a criminal justice agency, government body or NGO overseas.
If you are already in employment, the particular benefit of our LLM is that you can combine modules to create a programme of study which reflects your specific vocation and future employment and career aspirations.

What you will study
Your core and option modules are based on whether you are studying the general LLM pathway or a specialist named pathway.
Core modules
Whichever route you choose, you will take the following core modules:
Legal Scholarship
You’ll enhance your research, communication and independent study techniques, which will help you throughout your Masters degree and will also assist with your personal and professional development. This module provides a stepping stone if you wish to present your work at conferences or have your work published. The skills you develop will also be of direct relevance if you are seeking to undertake a PhD and will help you progress through the early stages of a research career.
Independent Studies
This module gives you the opportunity to develop deep and specialist knowledge through robust legal scholarship. You will use the intellectual skills you’ve gained during your course to carry out an extensive investigation of a significant topic. You will be supported throughout by a member of our law team with expertise in the area you choose to research.
If you plan to complete the general LLM, you will also study five modules from our extensive list of options. If you are taking a specialist LLM pathway, you will study two prescribed modules which align with your pathway specialism, alongside three option modules which you can select to match your individual interests.
The core modules for each pathway are as follows:
LLM (Commercial Law)
Commercial Theories – covering the historical development of commercialism; economic, political and social theories of commercialism; American realism; critical legal studies; socio-legal studies; law and economics; and globalisation
National and International Sale of Goods – exploring themes such as distribution contracts, licences, franchises, negotiable instruments and credit financing.
LLM (Corporate and Financial Law)

International Banking and Finance Law – exploring the systems for regulating financial markets, viewed within the context of the recent ‘banking crisis’ and changing political and economic conditions on a global scale.
LLM (International Protection of Human Rights and Personal Freedom)
The Law and Investigation of Human Rights Violations – focusing on practical approaches to the investigation of human rights violations and the issues and concerns which should inform your investigations in this field
Public International Law – charting the application of legal rules which regulate relations between states, including the relevance of customary law, the establishment of treaties to promote state responsibility and the liability of state where these rules are breached.
LLM (Intellectual Property and Information Technology Law)
International Protection of Intellectual Property Rights - focuses on the continuing impacts of international intellectual property law and policy, on substantive national intellectual property laws, as well as the continuing challenges of territoriality and trans-border protection for national intellectual property rights

How you will learn
You'll learn with your peers, giving you the chance to collaborate with other talented people who share your passion for the same kinds of legal issues.
Your lectures will provide a solid foundation in the areas of study. Seminar discussion groups will guide you in your study as well as stimulating your interest to explore specific topics further.
The LLM course will enhance your independent research and writing skills, enabling you to develop strong legal arguments that you can draw on for your assessments and assignment submissions.
How you'll be assessed
Types of assessment include assignments, portfolio preparation, reports, presentations and online preparation of material. In several modules you can relate your assessment to different jurisdictions, so that your national law can be the focus of your award.
Assessment is integrated into the learning and teaching of modules. The scheduling of work is consistent, balanced and inclusive in line with your progressive development.
The final Masters stage is assessed through the submission of your Independent Study or Masters thesis on a specialist topic of your own choosing. Our tutors will support you in preparing this.
