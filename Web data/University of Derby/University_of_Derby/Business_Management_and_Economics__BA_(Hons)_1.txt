The recent global economic and financial crisis has led to a growing interest in the subject area of applied economics. It has highlighted the importance of understanding economic analysis within organisations and the business community. Our Business Management and Economics course is designed to apply economic theory to real-life situations. We will use our academic expertise to help you make robust links between economic theoretical frameworks and the practicalities of the real world.  We place a great emphasis on practical, real-world learning through industry projects, links with our overseas partners, and the chance to take a placement year between your second and third year.
Tailor your degree
With a range of optional modules across areas such as logistics, human resource management, marketing, enterprise and finance, you’ll be able to tailor your studies to your area of interest and your career goals.
Professionally approved **
Chartered Management Institute accreditation means the CMI has independently assessed that the course meets its own high standards and priorities. The CMI is a UK professional body dedicated to promoting excellence in management and leadership. CMI accreditation is, therefore, a sign of a high-quality degree.
Students receive this accreditation if they pass the Business Management modules in their first year and select and pass required modules in their second year.
Optional placement year or internships
You can choose to take a placement year between years two and three of your degree, which would super-charge your employability and improve your prospects after graduation. We can help you to find a placement and provide support throughout your year away. If that's not for you, you can choose to complete internships during the summer breaks instead.
Choose your pathway
Studying a Business Management and Economics Joint Honours degree allows you to choose whether you major in one subject or study them both equally.
You begin this degree by studying both subjects equally in your first year. By the end of your first year, you will then decide whether you would like to major or minor in a chosen subject or continue to study them both equally.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
