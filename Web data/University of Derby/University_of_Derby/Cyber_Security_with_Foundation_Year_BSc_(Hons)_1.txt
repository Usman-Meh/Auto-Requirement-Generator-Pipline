Foundation Year - helping you to achieve more
Including a foundation year as part of your four-year study programme will give you a head start in your academic and professional life. The foundation year offers the chance to strengthen your skills, knowledge and confidence – with extensive support from our expert staff – before you advance to stage one of your honours degree. It could also be beneficial if you are planning a career change and want to get to grips with aspects of subjects which are new to you.
Our degrees with a foundation year are continuous, meaning that you won’t need to apply again once you have successfully completed the first year.
High-level technical skills
Security is a vital requirement of computer-based systems. As the number of security-related incidents continues to grow, so does the demand for expertise in cyber security. As companies increasingly look to defend themselves against cyber attacks, the number of job openings is growing rapidly. If you have an interest in latest technologies, a flair for problem-solving and a capacity for quick thinking, a fulfilling career in cyber security is for you.
Our BSc (Hons) Cyber Security prepares you to become a successful security specialist. You will study security policies, legal and regulatory requirements, risk and vulnerability assessment, security architecture and development, information assurance methodologies, ethical hacking and incident management.
We will equip you with the know-how to critically analyse and evaluate responses to security-related incidents. You will also develop the technical skills needed to specify, build and develop the physical infrastructure and software to ensure solutions are robust and secure.
Benefit from flexibility
You’ll gain fundamental knowledge in the first year of studying our BSc (Hons) Cyber Security degree alongside students on our other Computing degrees. You’ll then have the option to transfer to one of the following courses if you wish:
BSc (Hons) Computer Science
BSc (Hons) Computer Games Programming
BSc (Hons) Information Technology
BSc (Hons) Artificial Intelligence and Data Science
(subject to Mathematics prerequisites)
You’ll then go on to study more specialist modules in year two with further options to tailor your studies to an area of your interest in your final year.
My placement year at IBM has been an invaluable experience where I have gained an abundance of new technical skills and a wide network of skilled individuals, giving me the chance to learn from those those that have years of expertise within the field.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
