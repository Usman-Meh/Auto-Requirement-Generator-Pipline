BA (Hons) Education Studies - National Student Survey 2024
Start your journey towards a BA (Hons) Education Studies with our foundation year. This course will build your knowledge and confidence while offering an excellent introduction to all aspects of education – from early years to lifelong learning.
From day one of the foundation year stage, you’ll enjoy all the benefits of being a University of Derby student, along with extra support to help you build your knowledge, skills and confidence.
A broad spectrum of knowledge
You will be provided with a solid understanding of education and educational equality, bringing together perspectives from history, psychology, sociology and philosophy.
You will attending an intellectually stimulating course that will make you an authority on current education policy and practice.
You can choose to build on this core knowledge by following one of our specialist pathways in Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) or Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL).
Real-world learning in action
Even if you choose not to study a specialist pathway, you’ll still undertake a 12-day work placement in an education setting during stage two of the course.
A Global Outlook
We offer exciting opportunities for you to travel abroad to broaden your horizons. Our programme of international fieldtrips has given our students first-hand experience of education in countries such as Morocco, The Gambia and Kenya.
These experiences provide you with valuable insights into different contexts and levels of educational provision as well as critical issues surrounding economic, social and cultural development.
Choose your pathway
Build a degree to reflect your personal interests by taking one of our two optional specialist pathways:
Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND) Pathway
This pathway has been developed in response to a growing demand for high-calibre trained staff who can work with learners with special educational needs and/or disability.
You’ll explore a range of SEND practitioner roles and the ways that government policy impacts upon such roles, inside and outside the classroom. Our strong links with schools and colleges – both special and mainstream – mean you can learn from leading professionals working in the SEND field.
TESOL Pathway
This pathway is ideal if you want to focus on English language teaching for learners in a variety of contexts. It equips you with the skills to work with English as an Additional Language (EAL) pupils in a primary or secondary setting; to work abroad as an English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teacher; or to work as a teacher of English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) in an adult or community environment.
You’ll undertake observed teaching practice to give you vital experience and enhance your employability. We introduce you to various approaches for teaching grammar, vocabulary, reading, writing, listening, speaking and pronunciation. You’ll also look at lesson planning, syllabus design and assessment. In addition, we encourage you to reflect upon your own knowledge and understanding of the English language.
A vibrant learning experience
You will be taught by influential researchers and published authors whose work is shaping the debate about the future of education. Their research in education includes topics such as inclusion, diversity, social equality, online learning and pastoral care in primary, secondary and higher education.
Foundation Year - helping you to achieve more
Including a foundation year as part of your four-year study programme will give you a head start in your academic and professional life. The foundation year offers the chance to strengthen your skills, knowledge and confidence – with extensive support from our expert staff – before you advance to stage one of your honours degree. It could also be beneficial if you are planning a career change and want to get to grips with aspects of subjects which are new to you.
Our degrees with a foundation year are continuous, meaning that you won’t need to apply again once you have successfully completed the first year.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
