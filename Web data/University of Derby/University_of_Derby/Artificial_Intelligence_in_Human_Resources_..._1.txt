Artificial Intelligence in Human Resources at Derby
From driving decisions about hiring, to revolutionising the creation of policies, contracts and job descriptions, the implementation of AI in the field of Human Resource Management means it’s an exciting time to develop as a graduate at the forefront of this new technology.
The modern HR toolkit utilises AI for interview insights, personality assessments, analysing employee performance, employee engagement and talent development. The growth in this field means graduates that can combine the traditional aspects of Human Resource management with emerging technologies will be in high demand.
Human Resource Management is an industry with people at its heart, so you will not only explore the growing opportunities automation and computer-based intelligence offers, but also the ethics and challenges of balancing this with the real world and real people.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
