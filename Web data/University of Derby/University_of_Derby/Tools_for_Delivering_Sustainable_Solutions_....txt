The level 7 Certificate of Credit in Tools for Delivering Sustainable Solutions to Environmental Problems is a 20 credit module providing a critical understanding of the sources and nature of environmental problems as well as the key environmental management tools and techniques available to environmental professionals and organisations. To prevent and overcome environmental problems of any scale, a range of tools will be introduced in the module, in particular, environmental management systems (EMS) and environmental audits which are key environmental management tools with organisations today.
The module, which has been developed with input from the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment (IEMA), is suitable for individuals responsible for conducting environmental audits or implementing environmental management systems within organisations. Whilst this module is an opportunity to enhance your CPD and add to your professional portfolio, it is also an excellent opportunity to experience our IEMA accredited
online Sustainability and Environmental Management MSc
before making a commitment to study the full programme.
By completing this module, you’ll gain a critical understanding of the pollution linkages and their impacts and the range of environmental management tools available for dealing with them in a sustainable manner.
Finally it will give you a greater understanding of developing your abilities to work within a team and to apply a major environmental management tool in a professional manner.
