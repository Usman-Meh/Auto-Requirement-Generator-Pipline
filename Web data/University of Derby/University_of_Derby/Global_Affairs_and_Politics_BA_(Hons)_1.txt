First understand. Then influence.
This unique BA (Hons) in Global Affairs and Politics is for people who want to understand and influence what is happening in the world — at either a local, regional, national or international level. It's the perfect time to launch this programme because never in human history has so much rapid change been apparent. The climate crisis, biodiversity and habitat loss, the Covid-19 pandemic, the rise of populism, threats to free speech and democracy around the world, ageing populations: these are just some of the challenges we face as we begin the 2020s.
At the same time there are many areas of opportunity. New and sustainable technologies promise a future with clean energy and zero-emissions vehicles, while social media enables people to work together to challenge  prevailing orthodoxies, prejudices and governments. There is youth activism and widespread movements for racial and societal justice.
If you want to play a role in shaping some of these crucial global issues, this BA (Hons) in Global Affairs and Politics is a great starting point. The world needs well-informed, culturally aware citizens who can research and analyse the data, problem-solve and negotiate — and this is exactly what you will learn to do on this degree.
If these quotes resonate with you, we think you're right for this course:
"I have learned that you are never too small to make a difference"
— Greta Thunberg, environmental activist
"I'm an idealist without illusions"
— John F Kennedy
"The time is always right to do what is right."
— Martin Luther King Jr.
See issues from all angles
We'll discuss what's going on in the news each week and analyse the impact it's having — from political developments and technological or scientific breakthroughs, to economic matters and social movements. We'll also consider how the news is created and shaped, considering big issues such as freedom of the press and 'fake news'.
This course covers a huge variety of subjects, from politics and international affairs to anthropology, cultural studies, economics, data science, sociology, geography, history, languages, law, literature, international development, philosophy, marketing and media.
As well as giving you great all-round knowledge, this enables you to analyse issues from different viewpoints and learn that there is never just one way to look at a problem.
You will learn about:
Political power
, by studying politics and government at all levels, from parish councils to the UN
Policy making and influencing
: How to bring about meaningful change by researching, analysing and proposing solutions to defined issues in society, the environment, or in government
Analysis and reporting
: The journalistic approaches used to research, analyse and report on the big issues of the day. You'll also work alongside journalists to produce your own news stories
Cultural contexts
: The different norms, attitudes, and disadvantage of the past and today and how this affects attitudes and behaviours. You'll learn to to work sensitively and with cultural intelligence.
We will also ensure you leave with a good understanding of the basics of data science, so that you can carefully assess some of the claims made by politicians and organisations in today's statistics-driven society.
Global and diverse
We expect this course to attract students from all over the world and are working with overseas universities to forge links. You will study issues from a wide range of countries including China, India, Brazil and America and you'll also learn from a diverse range of guest speakers. We also hope you will get involved in community projects, including those supporting the BAME (Black And Ethnic Minority) populations in our city and region.
Solve real problems
During this degree, you will get the opportunity to devise solutions to real problems and present your ideas to external audiences. In year two for example, there is a work experience module in which you'll be expected to work with a group, organisation or company on a project that either recommends or implements change. Then in year three, you'll get another opportunity to problem-solve with an advanced community or digital project, plus you'll develop a research paper about future sustainability and present its findings at a conference. So even while you're studying, you will have the chance to start making a difference.
Big spaces for big ideas
Kedleston Road offers it all: study in our largest library, relax at Basecamp, train in real-world healthcare settings, and stay active in our state-of-the-art Sports Centre.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
