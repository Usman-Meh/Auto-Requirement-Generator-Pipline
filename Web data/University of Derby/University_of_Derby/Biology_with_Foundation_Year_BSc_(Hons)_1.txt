Why study Biology
Many Biological processes are essentially circular in nature, providing a model for transitioning society to a circular economy which engineers out material and energy wastage. Governments, companies and inter-governmental agencies are investing in Biology because they see this potential and the economic need not only for environmental solutions, but also for the significant business opportunities enabled by recent progress in the Biosciences. Enormous advances in DNA sequencing technologies and related “omics”, plus the computational capacity to support these are transforming our understanding of Biology, leading to opportunities for enhancing health, wellbeing, and environment. Hence, Biology is a highly inter-disciplinary subject where collaboration with the other sciences is of key importance to success, ensuring that Biologists can play a role in all walks of life.
The world is being severely impacted by human pressures including climate change, overexploitation of natural capital, and irreversible biodiversity loss on a massive scale. These and other issues collectively represent an existential threat to humanity, and biology is at the cutting-edge for providing sustainable solutions. This programme answers the call from the UN, through UNESCO’s Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), to address the urgent and dramatic challenges to our planet, and to people. The module content and practical skills within the curriculum prepare graduates to make a positive impact on climate change, biodiversity loss, unsustainable resource use and inequality.
For people who want to be part of these solutions Biology is the ideal subject - enabling graduates to enter the workplace doing jobs that make a difference whether that is in the lab, in the field, or in the office.
Expert teaching
You’ll be taught by a highly qualified team, including many international researchers whose work is shaping debates in areas including ecology, entomology and biodiversity. They publish influential papers, speak at global conferences, and serve on the editorial boards of scientific journals. You'll benefit from this research as your lecturers bring the latest thinking to your studies, and in some cases you will have opportunities to get involved in research projects yourself.
Their wide-ranging work includes research into:
Improving the resilience of coral reefs to climate change
Plant conservation and biotechnology
Biodiversity ecosystem functioning
Cell biology
The evolution of primates
Insect reproduction and behaviour
Animal ecology
Coral Reef systems and megafauna
Soil microbiology
Research is carried out within the University's
Environmental Sustainability Research Centre
which aims to address local, national and global goals for sustainable development, environmental understanding and clean growth.
How we're helping corals survive
Our Aquatic Research Facility is carrying out work with organisations across the globe to make coral reefs more resilient in the face of man-made afflictions.

Foundation Year - helping you to achieve more
Including a foundation year as part of your four-year study programme will give you a head start in your academic and professional life. The foundation year offers the chance to strengthen your skills, knowledge and confidence – with extensive support from our expert staff – before you advance to stage one of your honours degree. It could also be beneficial if you are planning a career change and want to get to grips with aspects of subjects which are new to you.
Our degrees with a foundation year are continuous, meaning that you won’t need to apply again once you have successfully completed the first year.
Excellent fieldwork opportunities
Fieldwork is a vital element of our biology courses and so your studies will be enriched with fieldwork opportunities - the cost of mandatory fieldwork is included in your course fee. Through our fieldwork programme, we introduce students to a variety of survey techniques for a wide range of species, such as:
studying animal interaction at Twycross Zoo
conducting ecological projects in Mallorca
those selecting our optional
Tropical Marine Biology
module have undertaken scientific investigations in the Maldives
investigating plant adaptations at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew
exploring Toyota Motor Manufacturing UK Burnaston, to survey wildlife in their nature conservation area
You’ll also have access to Cuckoos Tor, a site on the edge of the Peak District National Park and owned by the University of Derby that is dedicated to long-term research and ecological experiments. Current projects include restoration ecology, natural flood risk management, community engagement with biodiversity, and sustainable land management - and you’ll be able to get involved.
For further practical experience, you'll have plenty of opportunity to apply for work placements and paid internships. All of this means you'll be well placed to launch your career, whether you are looking for a graduate job or are planning to go into further study or research.
"I went to Mallorca and the Maldives. Both were amazing. In Mallorca we surveyed rivers, mountains, forests, bird sanctuaries and nature reserves looking at all manner of species." Sam Lebbon, BSc (Hons) Biology, graduate
Partnerships to strengthen your knowledge
Once you have completed your Foundation Year, you'll have the chance to work with organisations such as Sea Life, Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, Derby Museums, and the Olive Ridley Project. These partnerships pave the way to work experience and internship opportunities where you can apply your skills in real world situations. They also give you access to field sites, employer-led projects and guest lectures – all of which broaden your perspective on the wealth of career opportunities open to Biology graduates.
We are currently working with Derbyshire Wildlife Trust and Derby City Council on
rewilding Allestree Park
. This is the UK’s largest rewilding space which has involved a community consultation to find out what local people want. Some of our students are already working on independent studies projects in the park, with one test-driving the citizen science protocols for monitoring the changes in the park as the rewilding continues.
We have also just won two associate Knowledge Transfer Partnership with Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, lasting two years, to predict the trajectory of rewilding ecosystems. This will enable you to learn about the remote sensing and modelling we use for this. It will also enable staff to further stretch their research impact in a complex and growing subject area, as well as providing the chance to apply cutting edge, technical research to commercial activities.
We have also been working for several years with
Down to Earth Derby
, on nature-based regeneration and connecting communities with nature and growing food. A major project we are working on at the moment, with the Eden Project, is a community garden on part of Sturgess Fields, a site owned by the University between Kedleston Road and Markeaton Street sites. The plan is to create a New Commons that will be managed with the community. There are lots of opportunities for you to work on here, both in creating and maintaining the site, undertaking ecological monitoring and getting involved in community education programmes.
A learning environment to inspire you
Our learning facilities have recently been upgraded, so you’ll have an up-to-date setting in which to develop high-level practical skills, including laboratories with modern instrumentation. There is also a student research laboratory where you’ll have a dedicated space for your final-year independent study.
Our Biology students also benefit from working in our
glasshouse
with plants from diverse habitats,
Aquatic Research Facility
, and
insectary
