What does ‘subject to validation’ mean?
We are continually looking at enhancing our courses to ensure they are up to date and relevant. This means we may add new courses or update existing courses in our portfolio. As this happens, the courses are advertised as ‘subject to validation’ to make you aware that the course you are looking at may not yet be finalised, or is undergoing changes.
Any course listed as ‘subject to validation’ is in the final stages of approval. Validation is a rigorous process undertaken with academic staff, students, independent subject experts and employers to ensure the course is current, of high quality, and able to prepare students well for their future employment or further study.
Success through validation is not guaranteed, which is why courses are highlighted as ‘subject to validation’. In the event the course is significantly amended, or does not meet the necessary requirements for a successful validation, we will get in touch to support you in finding a suitable alternative, either at the University of Derby or at another provider.

The BA Photography (Commercial) programme provides a uniquely progressive and ethically responsible take on the future of commercial photography practice and its associated industries. Through learning the technical needs to develop and work professionally in the field, students will commit to innovating beyond existing, conventional commercial practices to set new standards of visual language that advocates for contemporary and future-visioning clients.
Students benefit from this degree being one of very few specifically commercial photography programmes in Britain that offers the opportunity to work professionally from the outset. Students are encouraged to take on commercial photographic work and are given the opportunity to incorporate that work into their portfolio development throughout their studies. Specialist mentoring will be given throughout the process, from building a professional identity, marketing and media, initial dealings with clients, pitch deck presentations, production and management of work, key communication and engagement skills, to final presentation of that work to the client or given audience.

Foundation Year - helping you to achieve more
Including a foundation year as part of your four-year study programme will give you a head start in your academic and professional life. The foundation year offers the chance to strengthen your skills, knowledge and confidence – with extensive support from our expert staff – before you advance to stage one of your honours degree. It could also be beneficial if you are planning a career change and want to get to grips with aspects of subjects which are new to you.
Our degrees with a foundation year are continuous, meaning that you won’t need to apply again once you have successfully completed the first year.
Hone your skills
The programme is delivered through a combination of practice-led workshops alongside lectures, seminars, tutorial support, and national and international study visits. Whilst progressing through their studies, students work with the support of both actively working and researching photographic lecturers and industry professionals. Through engaging in exciting and intensive periods of risk-taking and creative explorations, students grow as autonomous practitioners and independent professionals with highly distinctive approaches that separate them from typical industry expectations.
BA Photography (Commercial) draws upon the celebrated legacy of the Derby School of Photography, the very first location for photography education in the UK. The programme works in tandem with other programmes across art, design and technology and in association with
FORMAT International Photography Festival
founded in Derby in 2004. The programme is recognised and supported by the professional photographic body, AOP (Association of Photographers).
Build, Create, Innovate
Whether it's computing, photography, or engineering, our top-tier facilities — including a new suite of recording studios and a £12 million STEM Centre — provide the perfect setting to excel.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
