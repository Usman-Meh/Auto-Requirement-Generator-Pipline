The NHS has also announced plans to prescribe lifestyle interventions  to patients in a bid to help tackle the rises in non-communicable diseases we have witnessed over the last half a century or more. By joining this course, you can make a positive impact on peoples’ health and wellbeing, as well as improving the quality of patient care for current and future generations of sportspeople and/or members of the public.
Sports Nutrition and Health at Derby
To meet the growing local and global demands for Sports Nutrition and Health experts, this course takes a multidisciplinary approach exploring the psychology, physiology and biochemistry theories of nutrition. To be successful in your career, whether you are interested in working with amateur or elite athletes or health and community-based environments, it is vital that you have an understanding of human psychology, disease, training, physical activity, and health. If you are keen to work in the sport performance sector, it is important to understand how nutrition plays a key role in how well an athlete performs, recovers, or adapts to their training, and how such principles are adaptable to optimising health.
As well as the theoretical teaching, we also integrate qualifications and unique work placements to our teaching. This allows you to work alongside academics and health professionals with a wide range of expertise to ensure that you develop the skills in all areas of health and performance improvement employers are looking for. Through our industry-informed programmes we have built links with many key employers, enabling students to undertake work experience with organisations like Derbyshire County Cricket Club, Derby County Football Club, Burton Albion Football Club, Leicester City Football Club, Leicester Tigers Rugby Club, Derbyshire Institute for Sport, Derventio Excel Swimming Squad and Derby Centre of Excellence for Ladies Football amongst others.
During your studies, we will also enhance your interpersonal and communication skills which are essential when working with members of the public. We will also teach you how to work independently and in a group, manage budgets, analyse and interpret data and solve problems, so you will graduate feeling confident in your abilities to speak with and advise different audiences.
The course content is mapped to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals to ensure graduates are equipped with skills and knowledge to solve tomorrow’s problems. By the end of your degree, you will have an understanding of:
•    human responses and adaptations to sport and exercise
•    the performance of sport and exercise and its enhancement, monitoring and analysis
•    health-related and disease management aspects of exercise and physical activity
•    historical, social, political, economic and cultural diffusion, distribution and impact of sport
•    policy, planning, management and delivery of sporting opportunities
This course has been designed and developed in collaboration with Derby City Council to provide you with the holistic skills you need for a career in all aspects of health and exercise promotion.
Learn in an industry led environment
Using the latest specialist equipment, you’ll get involved in nutritional and physiology testing, cardiometabolic health assessments, and psychology-based studies relating to physical activity and exercise.
We offer you the opportunity to complete your Level 2 gym instructor qualification and level 3 personal training qualification. Upon completion of your level 3 qualification, from a further training perspective, you could pursue a level 4 Advanced Personal Training qualification. Following the completion of your level 4 qualification, you could apply to become a BASES Certified Exercise Practitioner. You could also apply to become an Accredited Sport and Exercise Scientist via the BASES Supervised Experience (SE) programme and eventually apply to become a Chartered Scientist.
You will also have the opportunity to gain your Level 2 Food Hygiene Certificate. In addition to these qualifications, you will be expected to complete the UK Anti Doping Introduction to Clean Sport course or similar UKAD course. Alongside your degree, these additional qualifications and courses will help stand you in the best position to secure work experience, internships, and employment opportunities.
Internships are available and provide you with hands-on, applied, real-world experience. These opportunities vary year on year, but most often arise with local community health initiatives, local sports clubs, Team Derby (the University’s performance sport programme), or our very own
Human Performance Unit
.
You will also learn from industry experts through guest lecturers which tend to focus on potential careers, what those careers are like, and the path taken to achieve them. These sessions are rich with information, insight, knowledge, reality and a prime opportunity for you to network and start to gain outside contacts for sourcing advice and future opportunities.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
