Course description
The distinctive nature of this programme is represented by the flexibility of its design and delivery. Its construction and innovative modes of delivery recognise the diverse and dispersed nature of not only the industry itself, but the potential student body it will serve. Due to the geographical spread of the industry, manufacturing sites and offices are often remote and isolated. Technical and operational staff very often spend a significant proportion of their time working outdoors, can be transient (with seasonal working activities sometimes playing a part) and they may also find that they are suddenly re-located, in some cases abroad. The provision offered within this programme of study, has had to evolve to meet the needs of such learners: taking advantage not only of traditional teaching and learning techniques, but utilising the most advanced learning technology for teaching, learning, supervision and assessment.
Key Characteristics
The programme is designed to enable agile delivery of the teaching and learning activities
The programme delivery model comprises a blended distance learning model, which allows on-line learning material to be supported by face-to-face sessions
Delivery of face-to-face teaching is undertaken at the Enterprise Centre which provides a more corporate environment
Assessment strategies allow direct application of knowledge learned which is directly related to the workplace.
The programme enables the following opportunities:
Equips learners for shortfall in international, national and local development needs
Develops the learner’s knowledge and understanding of the Mineral Products sector and the context in which they operate, including global and environmental influences
Prepares individuals to be operationally effective in management positions in the Mineral Products industry by providing them with the tools to achieve this, a strong theoretical base and a range of skills relevant to today’s business practice
Enables a learner to develop their intellectual breadth and be able to make integrative links across the various areas of their organisations
Develops knowledge and skills to enable a leader/manager to be responsive to change
Increases capacity to learn, both on the programme and as independent lifelong learners following completion of the programme
To act as a role model, with responsibility for those in senior positions
Provides an academically rigorous and challenging programme of study aligned with the QAA Qualification Framework enhancing critical and reflective practice
Provides flexible learning opportunities in a diverse environment that widens participation.
Structure, certificates and assessment
Mineral Extraction and Transportation
This module provides an understanding of the issues associated with the exploration, and development of a mineral extraction site both here in the UK and internationally.
It will also develop knowledge of a range of health, safety, and environmental issues, which are relevant to mineral extraction operations, particularly in respect of risk control and the prevention of health and safety incidents and accidents.
Furthermore, the module develops the learners understanding of the techniques and principles employed in the extraction and transportation of minerals together with associated health, safety, and environmental issues in relation to current best practice and guidance.
Minerals Management and Processing
The module develops knowledge of a range of health, safety, and environmental issues in terms of best practice and guidance, which are relevant to extractives operations worldwide, particularly in respect of risk control and the prevention of health and safety incidents and accidents.
The issues associated with sustainable development, reclamation of mineral workings, managing waste and an understanding of best practice in relation to environmental law and legislation and its implication for the minerals extractive industry are also covered.
Furthermore, the module aims to develop knowledge and understanding of minerals processing and its applications within the industry, including feeding, crushing, screening, washing, separation, classification, and beneficiation techniques. The manufacture of cement is also included within the module.
Blasting Operations
This module is designed to enhance the skills and knowledge of personnel in the field of blasting. The objective of this module is to provide participants with a greater understanding of the requirements of blasting so that they are able to carry out their responsibilities in a safe and environment conscious manner, without risk of causing injury or damage and to maximise blasting performance whilst optimising overall operating costs.
Business and Operational Management (Optional)
This module develops the operational, business and financial knowledge and skills necessary to achieve the effective management of a mineral products facility.
This includes an understanding of the human implications of running a successful business. The module also recognises the importance of communication (written and none written skills), people and values in developing a positive workplace culture.
Furthermore, the concepts and principles of asset management are introduced to develop skills in relation to performance measurement and monitoring. To meet with modern day challenges students are also provided with the fundamentals of building a sustainable business and the concept of cyber security. Additionally, for apprentices this module supports and develops completion of the e-portfolio required for End Point Assessment purposes.
Mineral Products Work-based Project (Optional)
This module brings together the learner’s knowledge of the industry gained from the programme and asks them to offer a detailed discussion of a problematic area and locate it within the wider context of current academic and professional thinking as presented in the literature and within the context of the area of the Mineral Product industry in which they work. Learners will be expected to demonstrate the ability to diagnose an organisational issue, to present this issue in a coherent manner, and to draw conclusions from their reading, personal analysis and workplace experience.
*Not available as an option until September 2023*
How you will learn
The programme is influenced by the principles of work-based learning. As such a flexible range of teaching and learning methodologies are used relevant to particular groups or practices. For example:
Face to face taught modules combining tutor input with structured opportunities for discussion, reflection and planning for workplace application
Learning opportunities identified and taken directly from the learner’s workplace situation
Action learning sets and other facilitated group activities
Individual reflection on learning
Technology enhanced learning using a sophisticated virtual learning environment (VLE).
At undergraduate level, the emphasis is on fostering independent learning, whilst providing a supporting environment in which to study at higher level. One of the key aims of any undergraduate programme is to produce an independent learner capable of properly managing their time and resources to identify issues, decide how to collect and analyse evidence and reach reasoned evidence based conclusions, and to subsequently present this information via various methods of communication (written and oral).
Indicative methods of assessment include activities such as:
practical projects focused on particular workplaces
management and technical reports
annotated presentations
reflective portfolios or collections of work completed throughout the module / programme
E-assessments via the Virtual Learning Environment
problem solving tasks
varied writing tasks and oral assessment
practical assessment of professional competence
These indicative approaches will be used to test attainment of knowledge and understanding as well as skills and capabilities thereby promoting ‘deep learning’.
Entry requirements
The programme has been designed to appeal to a wide audience.
Operational managers, assistant managers and supervisors within the industry who have significant experience but limited qualifications, who wish to improve their level of competence within the industry.
Graduate employees who already possess a degree in a related subject (e.g. mining engineering or geology), but who need to specialise in the sector.
Employees from industry suppliers/manufacturers who would like to gain knowledge of the sector in order to better serve their specific industry clients.
Consultants who would like to gain knowledge in a wider sense within the mineral products environment in order to support the service that they provide.
The following broad criteria applying for entry:
Learners are employed or have affiliation with an employer.
Learners will have been nominated to attend following a review/discussion with their line manager and/or recruitment manager.
Learners will have been identified by the organisation as being able to succeed on the programme.
The selection of participants is consistent with the University’s equal opportunities policies and sensitive to legal obligations to avoid discrimination on the basis of gender, race or disability.
