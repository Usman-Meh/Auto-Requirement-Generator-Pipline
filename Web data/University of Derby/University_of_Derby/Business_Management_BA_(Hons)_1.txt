Let's do business
You'll learn about organisations, their management and the global environments in which they operate. You’ll learn new ways of thinking as well as a host of practical skills.
And you'll be challenged to apply these to real-world business and management scenarios through projects, placements and internships. On this course, everyone gets to do business as well as learn about business.
We’ll help you prepare for a career in a global business environment that is rapidly changing. We'll support you to become more agile, innovative and resilient. You will also develop self-learning and team-working skills, both crucial to success in the professional sphere.
Importantly, you will also learn to see things differently, by working with students from many other countries - both in your classes and online through joint projects with our overseas partner universities. You will see how people from different cultures tackle the same business issue. And you'll discover that who we are and where we are affect how we do business.
Hot topics
We have recently updated this business management programme, so you will cover many growth areas and hot topics, including:
responsible management
business ethics
business analytics
digital media
innovation and globalisation
Choose your pathway
All our Business Management degrees have a common first year. After that you can continue on our Business Management BA (Hons) or you can choose one of our specialist pathways:
Business Management, Supply Chain and Logistics BA (Hons)
Business Management and Entrepreneurship BA (Hons)
Business Management and Finance BA (Hons)
Business Management and Human Resource Management BA (Hons)
Business Management and Marketing BA (Hons)
Business Management and Business Technology BA (Hons)

Chartered Management Institute
accreditation means the CMI has independently assessed that the course meets its own high standards and priorities. The CMI is a UK professional body dedicated to promoting excellence in management and leadership. CMI accreditation is, therefore, a sign of a high-quality degree.
And, because the course is 'dual accredited', you will also automatically receive a CMI professional qualification when you graduate, on top of your BA (Hons) from us!

This is a fantastic opportunity to put to use all your newly-acquired knowledge and skills and prove what you can do. Not only will you gain valuable experience, but you will also become much more confident in your abilities.
Optional placement year or internships
You can choose to take a placement year between years two and three of your degree, which would super-charge your employability and improve your prospects after graduation. We can help you to find a placement and provide support throughout your year away. If that's not for you, you can choose to complete internships during the summer breaks instead.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
