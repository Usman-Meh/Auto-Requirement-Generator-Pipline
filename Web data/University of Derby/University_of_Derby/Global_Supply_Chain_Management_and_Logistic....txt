Online course description
This course critically analyses the increasing need for effectively managing the global supply chain. This aspect of an organisation is seen as a ‘strategic asset’ which can improve efficiency, customer satisfaction and financial results. As a consequence, managing the supply chain is key in terms of how an organisation performs with regard to its goals and strategy.
Through a series of case study approaches, both live and historic, you will gain an appreciation of the vast nature of the supply chain, from tangible raw materials to the often intangible transfer of knowledge. You will critically analyse the infinite relationships involved in inward and outward logistics through the upstream and downstream operations. And through this gain an appreciation of how these chains should be managed to maximise customer satisfaction and value added, and therefore performance.
The course will facilitate the analysis of the pressure to improve internal operations, how logistics strategies should evolve and be implemented and how integrated supply chains are developed. You will gain a critical appreciation of a breadth and depth of disciplines and how they culminate in impacting upon the supply chain, and how these impacts should be managed.
Learning outcomes
On successful completion of the course, you will be able to:
Critically analyse the management of resource within the global supply chain
Critically evaluate the need to either outsource or in-source elements of the supply chain, from a global, national or local perspective
Critically evaluate backward and forward growth in the supply chain, and how to manage supply chain risk
Undertake comprehensive and critical research of both academic and organisational materials, showing a suitable breadth and depth of sources in the development of reasoned conclusions
