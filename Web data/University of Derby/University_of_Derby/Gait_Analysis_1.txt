Course description
Whether you are starting out as a runner, aiming to improve your personal best or preparing specifically for a competition, we have a bespoke service to support you. Our gait clinic has been designed to support runners of all levels on an individual basis. We will analyse your current running technique and aim to make meaningful changes to improve running efficiency and reduce the onset of running related injury.
Learning outcomes
What's involved?
During the one hour assessment you will undertake a warm-up before completing a 15 minute data collection on the treadmill. Using a combination of high speed video and the OPTOJUMP analysis system we will analyse your running technique before generating a user-friendly report which outlines some of the key technical areas for improvement. Once you’ve had time to cool down we’ll debrief and discuss the findings of your report.
Benefits
Follow-up coaching sessions
Follow-up coaching sessions are available. A 30 minute follow up coaching session will enhance your experience and address technical changes recommended in your gait analysis report.
Fees and funding
Cost: £60 per person
For follow up coaching sessions: £50 per person
