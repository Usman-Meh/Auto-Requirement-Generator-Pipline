Our level 7 Certificate of Credit in Sustainable Business Management is a 20-credit module providing critical knowledge and understanding of the corporate sustainability challenge facing organisations as well as the skills required to drive the improvement in organisational culture and environmental performance resulting in more sustainable, future-fit businesses.
The module, which has been developed with input from the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment (IEMA), is suitable for intending and existing environmental management professionals seeking to expand their knowledge base to include the principles of sustainable business practice. Business managers without a sustainability background or qualification can also benefit from this module.
Whilst this module is an opportunity for environmental practitioners to enhance their CPD and add to their professional portfolio, it is also an excellent opportunity to experience our IEMA-accredited
online Sustainability and Environmental Management MSc
before making a commitment to study the full programme.
By completing this module, you will be able to critically evaluate the changing role of businesses in a sustainable world, develop programmes to achieve sustainable change and make a business case for financial investment in such programmes. You will also gain a critical understanding of the role of communication, effective stakeholder engagement and reporting in sustainable business management.
