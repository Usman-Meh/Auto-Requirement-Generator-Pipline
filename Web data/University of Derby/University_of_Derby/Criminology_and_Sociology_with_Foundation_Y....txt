Foundation Year - helping you to achieve more
Including a foundation year as part of your four-year study programme will give you a head start in your academic and professional life. The foundation year offers the chance to strengthen your skills, knowledge and confidence – with extensive support from our expert staff – before you advance to stage one of your honours degree. It could also be beneficial if you are planning a career change and want to get to grips with aspects of subjects which are new to you.
Our degrees with a foundation year are continuous, meaning that you won’t need to apply again once you have successfully completed the first year.
A need for change
The Covid-19 pandemic and national lockdowns have highlighted the social and economic factors that impact crime numbers and types. Anti-social behaviour and drug offences have risen, with overall crime rates remaining higher in areas facing poverty and low educational attainment.
This course seeks to address these differences and find community-based solutions that will reduce criminality.
Why Criminology and Sociology?
Combining insights from both these disciplines will give you a deep understanding of what shapes people’s behaviour, beliefs and attitudes. You’ll explore the reasons why people commit crime and the social factors at play, including inequality, prejudice and substance abuse.
You’ll also look at the impact that crime has on both local communities and wider society. And you’ll apply your learning to help make a difference with local communities.
This course could open up career opportunities to work for or with national or local government, the charity sector, the voluntary sector, social or health services.
Real-world impact
This is a highly relevant degree that tackles current issues head-on. We’ll help you develop strong research and analytical skills to understand and evaluate criminal behaviour and responses to it.
You’ll work with local and national community organisations on live briefs, offering research and solutions to the key issues they deal with.
Study visits and fieldtrips will give you intriguing insights into how organisations work. These could include visits to courts, prisons, police forces and youth offender training centres.
Global thinking
Global perspectives are an integral part of our Criminology and Social Sciences courses. Exploring how other countries approach criminal justice and social issues is key to learning how we can make positive changes moving forward.
Past students have had opportunities to go on field trips that focus on specific aspects of the course, such as conflict resolution.
In your third year, there may be an opportunity to go on study trips to such places as the International Criminal Court to bring your learning to life.
Expert teaching
You’ll learn from a team with a wealth of knowledge; these include researchers, police officers, sociologists and criminologists. Many are still actively practising, which helps you keep up to date with contemporary issues.
As a BA (Hons) Criminology and Sociology student, you can take part in regular departmental research seminars delivered by leading professionals and academics from other institutions. You’ll also have the chance to meet influential leaders in the profession. Our regular programme of guest speakers keeps you in tune with the latest developments in policy and practice. Previous guest speakers include crown court judges, police investigators and professionals from the youth justice practice.
Research projects cover everything from drug use, hate crime and human trafficking to extremism and counter-terrorism, organised crime and conspiracy theories. So your teaching will be informed by the latest thinking in this field, and you may have the chance to get involved yourself.
Where you'll study
You’ll be based on the Derby Campus at One Friar Gate Square. Offering the perfect environment for innovative and engaging teaching, it includes well-resourced lecture theatres, seminar rooms, and social learning spaces.
You will study alongside our Law, Policing and Social Sciences students, sharing knowledge and expertise. You’ll gain practical experience using our first-rate facilities including a replica crown court and police custody suite, complete with interview rooms and cell.
The Gateway to Your Legal Career
Our modern, iconic building offers state-of-the-art facilities like a replica Crown Court and Custody Suite. Just a short walk from the city centre, One Friar Gate Square is designed to elevate your academic journey.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.

Careers
BA (Hons) Criminology and Sociology provides an excellent basis for developing careers in local or national government, in organisations working towards social justice in a variety of contexts, or in professional settings concerned with conflict resolution or security and risk assessment. Alternatively, students can choose to pursue careers in the criminal justice sector: in policing, prisons, probation as well as private sector companies that operate in the sector.
Opportunities for graduates may also be available in areas such as housing, family services, youth work, or other aspects of social care. Graduates should also consider exploring prospective careers in health care planning and public health engagement. The critical insights and broad perspectives offered through the course means that we would hope students would be able to choose to work in service delivery, management, or strategic planning roles.
