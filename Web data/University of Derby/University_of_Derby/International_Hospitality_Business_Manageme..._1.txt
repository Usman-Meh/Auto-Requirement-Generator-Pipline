You’re in control
Studying online gives you the flexibility to study at the most convenient time and place for you. Course modules still operate within a fixed trimester but you can choose to study during the day, in the evenings or at the weekend rather than having to attend fixed lectures. This can be invaluable when you’re working in a busy hospitality role, because we know it’s not easy to get time off work. Throughout the course we’ll ask you to test out what you’re learning in your day-to-day role, and use your own experiences in assignments. Ultimately this should mean you find the course more useful for your career.
Institute of Hospitality Educational Membership Scheme
Through our partnership with the Institute of Hospitality you'll be given free access to the  (EMS) once you've enrolled onto this course. This gives you access to management guides, monthly specialist newsletters, e-journals, webinars and much more.
