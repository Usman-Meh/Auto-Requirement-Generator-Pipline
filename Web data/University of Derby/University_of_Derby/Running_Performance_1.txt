Course description
Our services are specifically tailored to provide support for athletes of all levels, from beginners to elite performers. Our expert team currently offer in-depth analyses of running technique and accurate physiological testing to help you personalise and make the most of your training.
If you're serious about your running, take the next step to optimising your performance. Any level of athlete can benefit from our assessments - choose the best one to suit your needs. Once you have purchased a package, the Human Performance Unit will call you back to arrange a time and date.
Learning outcomes
We have three packages to choose from so you can select the best for your needs.
Experience Package - £105
Ever wondered just how good professional runners are? Why not book our experience package to find out how your compare to the best in the World? The laboratory experience package has been designed to provide you with accurate physiological data that can be used to guide your training and ensure that you can perform optimally during competition. Data from this package can be used to establish training zones and individualise your training programme. It will also identify your strengths and weaknesses and establish just how you compare to an elite runner.
This package includes the following battery of tests:
Body composition assessment using bioelectrical impedance
Blood lactate assessment during sub-maximal treadmill protocol
Lactate threshold is one of the most commonly, and effectively assessed performance markers. The point is to learn the highest intensity at which you race and train before ‘hitting the wall’ from high levels of blood lactate. The aim of this test is to determine your highest sustainable level of lactate accumulation before it seriously hinders your performance - your lactate threshold. The most accurate way to determine lactate threshold is via a graded exercise test on the treadmill. During the test, running velocity will be increased from low intensity at 3 minute intervals with finger prick blood samples being taken in between each increment. Heart rate and RPE will also be measured throughout the test. The treadmill test lasts for around 20-30 minutes – this is not an ‘all out’ maximum test
Following these tests, you will be provided with all results, an explanation of what each metric means to you and your running and a comparison to pro athletes. We will also identify some specific training you can do to target each of the metrics.
Advanced Package - £150
This package includes all the benefits of the Experience Package plus the following:
Body composition assessment using bioelectrical impedance (DEXA scans are available for additional cost)
Blood lactate assessment
Plus:
VO2 max
Once we have identified clear lactate turn points the protocol will change to 1 minute steps which you complete until exhaustion. This will enable VO2 max to be calculated)
Running Economy Test – 3 x 4 minute Sub Max pace with gas analysis
This package comes with advanced analysis of your results and training zones, provides you with some more accurate performance modelling and comparison to pros and identifies specific sessions which you can target to improve your weaknesses and maximise your strengths.
Complete Package - £175
Want the most detailed analysis of your running performance? This package combines our advanced physiology package and measurements with a detailed analysis of your running technique.
