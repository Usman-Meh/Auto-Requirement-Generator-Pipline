Module description
About this module
The arena of work can provide many opportunities to develop critical thinking abilities. One such area is the leadership of projects. The skills required for the management and leadership of projects are transferable skills from the workplace arena to the academic arena. It therefore makes sense to link work based project achievement to academic achievement.
The project is the primary route by which you undertake the module supported by a practice and academic facilitator. The project is linked to the module outcomes by negotiation whereby you identify how and where the project meets the outcomes. You must provide evidenceÂ showing how the project management has to meet the demands of practice and academic criteria.
