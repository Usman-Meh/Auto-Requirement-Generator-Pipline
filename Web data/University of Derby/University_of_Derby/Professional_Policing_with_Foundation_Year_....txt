BA (Hons) Professional Policing
Foundation Year - helping you to achieve more
Including a foundation year as part of your four-year study programme will give you a head start in your academic and professional life. The foundation year offers the chance to strengthen your skills, knowledge and confidence – with extensive support from our expert staff – before you advance to stage one of your honours degree. It could also be beneficial if you are planning a career change and want to get to grips with aspects of subjects which are new to you.
Our degrees with a foundation year are continuous, meaning that you won’t need to apply again once you have successfully completed the first year.
Why this course?
Our BA (Hons) Professional Policing provides the ideal preparation for one of the most challenging professions of all. It equips you with an in-depth understanding of the role of a police officer today, including a thorough grasp of criminal justice systems and the powers and laws used by the police throughout England and Wales. You will graduate with a highly regarded and valuable qualification to stand you in good stead for a policing career.
Volunteering
You will be encouraged to seek work-based opportunities through membership in the Special Constabulary, as well as other volunteer opportunities. In the past, some of our students have been commended for their actions in the role of Special Constable by the forces they represent – including one student who helped to save someone's life.
Expert teaching
We have a team of academics with years of policing experience at all levels. You can also draw on our excellent network of contacts ranging from chief constables and crime commissioners to representatives of national and international policing organisations.
Our outstanding visiting speaker and events programme captures topical issues and debates. Recent guests have included policing experts from the USA – a retired police Captain, a retired Chief of Police and a current SWAT commander – who provided a unique insight into their policing models. In addition, the former Chief Constable of Derbyshire shared experiences from his career, the changes which have transformed the profession and the challenges for policing in the 21st Century.
Your studies will be underpinned by our leading-edge research into the explanations and motivations for criminal behaviour and how criminal activity can be detected and prevented. This includes a focus on the notion of policing itself, ethical codes, human rights and police governance.
Specialist facilities
As a BA (Hons) Professional Policing student, you will be based on the Derby Campus at One Friar Gate Square. Offering the perfect environment for innovative and engaging teaching, it includes:
A replica crown court
Custody suite
Interview rooms
Well-resourced lecture theatres
Seminar rooms
Social learning spaces.
Students have also been able to make use of other specialist facilities at the University such as our forensic crime scene house
Because you’ll be working alongside students taking courses in subjects such as law, criminology and sociology, there are many opportunities to share knowledge, expertise and experience.
The Gateway to Your Legal Career
Our modern, iconic building offers state-of-the-art facilities like a replica Crown Court and Custody Suite. Just a short walk from the city centre, One Friar Gate Square is designed to elevate your academic journey.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.

Our aim is to support all students to have the best possible opportunities to succeed and so our application and enrolment deadlines are in place to ensure you stand the best chance of doing so.

Careers
Because it is designed in close partnership with constabularies, this course is aimed mainly at ambitious individuals who want to pursue a career in policing. It paves the way for you to join a hugely rewarding profession which brings new challenges every day, demanding high levels of responsibility, dedication and integrity.
Although the BA (Hons) Professional Policing qualification will not guarantee you a position within the police service, it will set you apart as an attractive candidate to secure a role.
The skills you develop on the course could also prove invaluable for a career within the broader criminal justice system. You could, for instance, consider roles in areas such as civilian investigation, crime reduction partnerships, probation, security and loss prevention.
Throughout your studies, you will also benefit from our Personal Development Planning (PDP) scheme which enables you to reflect on your learning and develop your career ambitions. The support continues once you have completed your course too: you are entitled to further help and guidance from the Careers and Employment Service for up to three years after leaving the University.
