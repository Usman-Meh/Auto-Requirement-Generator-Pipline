We've developed this course with your future in mind. New technologies are revolutionising media and the ways in which people receive their sports news. Today’s digital technologies allow people to follow their chosen sports much more closely – and they expect a high level of expertise from those reporting on sport. We will equip you with the professional knowledge and multimedia skills to rise to this challenge.
Studying Specialist Sports Journalism with a Foundation Year provides you with a firm grounding in the skills and knowledge you need and introduces you to the subject of journalism, enabling you to achieve your full honours degree in four years.
New skills for a new era
In an age of digital news, there has never been a more exciting or challenging time to study sports journalism. This dynamic course enables you to produce compelling content for both traditional and emerging media platforms.  And, unlike with other courses, you’ll have the opportunity to specialise in a sport of your choice – from minority sports through to cricket, rugby and football.
You'll gain the core journalistic research and writing skills as well as studying media law and ethics. At the same time, you’ll develop a multi-platform mindset, producing print, radio and TV reports as well as creating blogs and podcasts, digital photos, audio/video stories and content for websites and mobile devices.
Meeting industry demand
We are collaborating closely with leading names in sport and media to ensure this degree delivers the right level of skills and knowledge. You’ll be equipped not only to cover sport as a journalist but also for the growing number of media relations roles in the sports industry.
The course has been developed following discussions with major media companies like the
BBC
, national and local newspapers, sports industry bodies and sports clubs themselves. Drawing on these strong partnerships, you’ll be able to extend your professional networks, gain practical work experience and hear guest lectures from experienced sports journalists.
Hone your expertise in sports news
Throughout your studies, you’ll gain significant hands-on experience of gathering and reporting news and information on your chosen sport.  You’ll also analyse traditional media coverage and the way in which social media and individual blogs are transforming sports journalism.
You are expected to gain an in-depth knowledge of your sport, covering every level from local grassroots players to the biggest names in international sport. We focus on the governance and business aspects of sport too, reflecting how these are never far from the headlines.
Exciting work experience opportunities
As part of your course, you’ll boost your CV by gaining practical work experience with a media or sports organisation in the UK or overseas. All our students are expected to have completed at least 15 days of work placement by the time they graduate.
The course features work-based modules where you can expand your professional know-how. We also encourage you to work with charities and other not-for-profit organisations to gain an insight into why media matters so much. In addition, you can contribute to the various print, radio and online news outlets at the University, which is itself a rich source of news and debate around sport.
Outstanding facilities
You'll be based at our main campus at Kedleston Road and at our Markeaton Street site where you'll discover our excellent facilities including three radio studios, a fully equipped television studio, video editing suites, Mac suites and a newsroom featuring the latest software.
You’ll work with industry-standard recording and editing software that is used worldwide. It means you’ll be both confident and competent with up-to-the-minute technology – giving you a real advantage when you're looking for a job.
Variety and versatility
Our emphasis is on fostering creative, versatile journalists with experience in a variety of production techniques. On top of this, you will gain journalistic expertise in your chosen sport, helping you to pursue a career in your specialist area of interest.
Alongside your traditional reporting skills, we want you to develop a passion for ideas and creative communication, to seek people out and find the human stories behind the headlines. You'll also focus on your intellectual and critical development, study research techniques and gain an understanding of audience theory.

Our degrees with a foundation year are continuous, meaning that you won’t need to apply again once you have successfully completed the first year.

How you will learn
We believe that you learn by doing.  In most of your degree, you will learn by doing Journalism.  Your foundation year is more theory based and you will study a wide range of subjects.
In the rest of your degree, as often as possible, you’ll be creating content for print, online, audio and video platforms. You’ll have opportunities to work on real-world projects and complete stories on location as a matter of course. You’ll gather sports news, interview people and write reports and features with accuracy.
Wherever possible, you’ll work with professional publishers and, if your work is good enough, you will see your articles published.
You’ll be taught by a team which has vast experience in journalism and you’ll gain fascinating insights into the profession thanks to our programme of guest lectures by sports journalists, broadcasters, historians and commentators. You’ll also go on visits to professional media companies.
Practical experience
Our great contacts with local and national radio and TV, newspapers and online outlets open the doors to a variety of work experience opportunities for you. We work closely with media organisations to enable you to have your work published.
In addition, you can hone your skills by contributing to our student-run media, helping with the radio or TV stations or writing for the
Phantom
newspaper. We’ll also encourage you to produce content for the online news and sports websites run by the Students’ Union.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
