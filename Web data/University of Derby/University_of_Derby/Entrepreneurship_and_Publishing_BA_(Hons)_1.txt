Explore the creative and commercial processes in publishing, while studying key business themes to allow you to generate innovative business solutions to succeed in the publishing industry and beyond.
Book and magazine publishing form an important part of the creative and cultural industries. Between the author completing a written manuscript and final publication there are a range of other industry professionals involved in the process, including literary agents, editors and publishers. You’ll explore this process to develop the ability to hypothesise, implement and monitor solutions to relevant problems within the worlds of professional writing, book publishing, and magazine publishing.
Alongside this you’ll explore wider themes of business, enterprise and entrepreneurship which will enable you to develop skills to start your own business or provide innovation to existing businesses.
Real world learning
Real world opportunities are embedded in the programme, including working on live briefs, projects set by external industry organisations and the option to take a business-based placement year between your second and third year to gain valuable work experience.
Our courses have a strong heritage of fostering links with regional, national and international partners, publishers, magazines, writing organisations, literary agents, book fairs and festivals and other literary organisations.
Practical skills for your future
Entrepreneurship is an essentially practical subject and as such we place great emphasis on real world learning. We’ll use our academic expertise to make the links between theoretical business and enterprise and entrepreneurship frameworks and the practicalities of the real business world. We’ve developed extensive links with the business community, especially through the Derby Network of Entrepreneurs, to enhance the practical focus of this degree.
Choose your pathway
Studying a Publishing and Entrepreneurship Joint Honours degree allows you to choose whether you major in Publishing subject or study them both equally.
You begin this degree by studying both subjects equally in your first year. By the end of your first year, you will then decide whether you would like to major in Publishing or continue to study them both equally.
BA (Hons) Entrepreneurship and Publishing
In this pathway you study Entrepreneurship and Publishing equally.
BA (Hons) Publishing with Entrepreneurship
In this combination Publishing is the major subject and Entrepreneurship is the minor subject.
What is a Joint Honours degree?
A Joint Honours degree offers students the opportunity to study two subjects.
A Joint Honours degree is a great option if:
You want to study two subjects you’re passionate about
You’ve got a specific career in mind and want to create a tailored degree to prepare you for the future
You want to study a new subject alongside one you’re already familiar with
Big spaces for big ideas

How you are assessed
Our assessment strategy for Publishing is designed to produce confident, articulate graduates with a broad set of skills.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
