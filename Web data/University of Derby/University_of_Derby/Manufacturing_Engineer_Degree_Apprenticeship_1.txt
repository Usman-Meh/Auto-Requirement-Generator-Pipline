80% is on-the-job learning. The remaining 20% is through 'blended learning' - a combination of face-to-face and online teaching. Face-to-face sessions are usually delivered in blocks and we can be flexible, arranging them to fit around the workplace.
Course description
The focus of this apprenticeship is on the advanced manufacturing techniques and project management skills required to launch products on time, on cost and to the right quality.
You can choose to study for one of the following qualifications, depending on your career specialism:
BEng (Hons) Manufacturing Engineering
BEng (Hons) Manufacturing Engineering with Mechanical Design
BEng (Hons) Manufacturing Engineering with Electronics
The first year of all three programmes will be the same, except for the BEng in Manufacturing Engineering with Electronics where one module of 20 credits (out of 120 credits) in that first year will be different.
All three programmes will cover essential knowledge such as:
Mathematics and science for engineers
Materials and manufacture
3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE)
How to run and manage business led projects
Engineering operations and business management
Manufacturing processes
Product improvement and engineering project management
Structure, certificates and assessment
This apprenticeship runs over a minimum of four years. You will be completing on-the-job learning and uploading evidence of this to an e-portfolio, at the same time as studying for a BEng (Hons) in either:
Manufacturing Engineering
Manufacturing Engineering with Mechanical Design
Manufacturing Engineering with Electronics
This academic study will make up 20% of the course and is delivered through 'blended learning' — a combination of face-to-face and online teaching. Face-to-face sessions will be in blocks and online learning can include group webinars, independent activities or reading for half a day per week between the block study sessions.

Academic requirements
Employers usually set their own selection criteria and entry requirements and we can work with them on this. However, typically an applicant might be expected to have level 3 qualifications, such as:
A-levels at grade C or above in both a mathematical based subject and a science, technology, engineering or additional mathematics related subject, or
90+ credits in an Engineering Level 3 BTEC.
In addition, candidates will typically have level 2 qualifications such as 5 GCSEs at Grade C or above, including in Mathematics, English and a science, technology or engineering related subject.
Fees and funding
The cost will be paid for by the employer.
More details for employers
The cost of this apprenticeship will normally be in line with the funding band £27,000 but we will consider individual agreements, depending on student numbers and your involvement.
