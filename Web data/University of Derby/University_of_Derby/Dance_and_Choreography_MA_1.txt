This postgraduate course in Dance and Choreography is a fantastic opportunity for Dance Artists to further their practice and be at the forefront of sector development. The MA is designed to guide and nurture those with a keen interest and skill in choreographing, providing a space in which you can push your creative boundaries and generate new and innovative work. Artists will have the opportunity to tap into regional, national and international networks and have access to an exceptional body of infrastructure and resources. Key areas that will be covered include:

Role/involvement of the audience in a work (the fourth wall and when/how/what happens when you break it)
The unique challenges of making work for indoor and outdoor contexts
Funding landscape and opportunities
Partnerships – who to develop them with and how to establish them
Developing commissions
Basics of health and safety in relation to the field (safe working practices/risk assessments/rigging)
