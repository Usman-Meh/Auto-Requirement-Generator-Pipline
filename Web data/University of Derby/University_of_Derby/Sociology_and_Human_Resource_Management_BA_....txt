How can performance in people be increased? How does this have a positive effect on a business? How has the modern world developed, where is it going
,
and how can we bring about change for the better?
Develop the skills, insights and ambition to not just understand the complexity of modern societies but to intervene in them and make a positive difference to the lives of others. Alongside this, you’ll gain a contemporary perspective on human resource management and how the management of people is central to the needs of a business.
At the forefront of change
The world we live in is changing rapidly and sociology is a dynamic and evolving subject. It is best placed to plot global change and how this impacts nations, communities and individual lives. Sociology at the University of Derby offers you a fantastic opportunity to develop the skills, insights and ambition to not just understand the complexity of modern societies but to intervene in them and make a positive difference to the lives of others.
Putting theory into practice
You’ll have the opportunity to take a year-long placement in a Human Resource Management setting to put the skills you’ve learned into practice in a real-world
environment. Alternatively, you can choose to study a semester abroad to explore Sociology on a global scale.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
