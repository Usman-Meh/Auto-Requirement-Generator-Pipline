For those interested in becoming a solicitor, the route to qualification is
changing
. At Derby Law School we are working hard to ensure that the necessary changes are made to our undergraduate and postgraduate courses to provide our students with maximum opportunity and flexibility to further their legal career.
For September 2025 entry we will be offering an LLM SQE which is the new route to train towards becoming a solicitor.
The course was interesting, relevant and practical. The materials have been faultless and extremely helpful in aiding understanding. An invaluable experience.

What you will study
The Derby LLM LPC is highly practical and is both knowledge and skills based. In accordance with the requirements of the
Solicitors Regulation Authority
(SRA), the LLM LPC is divided into three stages:
Stage one
You’ll study and be assessed in:
• Core subjects: business law and practice; litigation (civil and criminal); and property law and practice
• Professional conduct and regulation: covering the conduct of solicitors in their professional practice and the regulation of financial services and solicitors’ accounts
• The skills of writing, drafting, practical legal research, interviewing, advising and advocacy
• Wills and administration of estates
In addition, you’ll study certain aspects of taxation as part of these core subjects.
Stage two
At this stage, you’ll study and be assessed in three work-based ‘elective’ subjects of your choice. You’ll have the opportunity to concentrate on subjects which are directly relevant to your career aspirations or which are of greatest interest to you.
The range of elective subjects includes:
Advanced Criminal Litigation
Acquisitions and Mergers
Clinical Negligence and Personal Injury
Commercial Law
Commercial Litigation
Commercial Property
Employment Law
Family Law and Practice
Personal Injury and Clinical Negligence
Private Client (Estate Planning)
Please note we reserve the right to withdraw an option if an insufficient number of students choose that elective.
Stage three
Independent Study
The Independent Study forms an essential component of the LLM LPC. You will conduct a piece of independently researched work which will be a dissertation or practice-orientated report. This will provide you with an opportunity to engage with a specific area of practice or practice-related problems of your choice to deepen your understanding and enhance your research and employability skills.
Each dissertation will be supervised by an appropriate Independent Studies Supervisor with experience of practice. Each dissertation will be individually negotiated and agreed with the module leader, who will have experience of legal practice, and will be approved and monitored under the following general headings:
• Selection of a suitable topic, identification of potential scope and appropriateness
• Relevant literature search, evidence of thorough approach to reading
• Variety of materials selected as appropriate
• Research methodology, sources of information, time-scale for research
• Gathering relevant and appropriate evidence and critical analysis of data
• Evaluation of evidence against concepts
• Feasible conclusions and recommendations
• Sound findings
Theoretical groundings in research will be provided through access to lecture and online study materials.
Please note that our modules are subject to change - we review the content of our courses regularly, making changes where necessary to improve your experience and graduate prospects.
How you will learn
The main objective of the LLM LPC is to prepare you for a training contract. Study is practice based, allowing you to gain an understanding of many common legal transactions and procedures. Workshops are taught in small groups, with a 30-minute review session to allow in-depth feedback.
You’ll have every opportunity to practice legal skills, such as interviewing and negotiation, through role play. When not in classes you will work individually and with other members of your group on preparatory tasks and exercises to consolidate your learning.
Additional support is available through our e-learning delivery system. This will help you assess your progress regularly through self-test questions and exercises with instant feedback.
Who you will meet
The LLM LPC is taught by a team of experienced solicitors, with most still active in practice.
The team includes:
Liz Haysom
Claire Greenhalgh
Romasa Butt
Flexible study
If you are a part-time student, you will attend compulsory weekend study sessions every Saturday during term time over two academic years, although some electives will be taught on Fridays or Sundays. Full-time students will attend compulsory study sessions every Friday and Saturday over one academic year.
Assessments
Most assessments are written but there are also skills assessments. The nature of assessments is largely determined by the SRA, but we do offer students a choice of when to take their assessments. Full details are set out in the Student Handbook.

Entry requirements
This course is for those wishing to become a solicitor. It is the second stage of your path towards qualification after your qualifying law degree. The course is based on work-related skills and introduces you to the vocational skills of legal practice. Whether you aspire to work in a city or commercial practice, a high-street or niche practice, or in-house, our LLM LPC provides an excellent foundation for your future career in law.
You will need:
A Qualifying Law degree (2.2 or above)
Graduate Diploma in Law/CPE with an undergraduate degree (2.2 or above)
Overseas students will also need:
A minimum IELTS 7.5 overall with a minimum of 6.5 in each skills area
Accredited Prior Learning (APL)
Applications from students who have successfully completed either a Bar Vocational Course (BVC) or Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) within five years of enrolment to our LLM LPC may be considered for exemption from attendance and assessment in the following:
Stage One - Litigation; Advocacy; Drafting
Stage Two - Two Vocational Electives
It is important for such students to contact the Programme Leader as promptly as possible prior to their application to the Central Applications Board to allow their APL application to be considered.
SRA’s Suitability Test
If you wish to qualify as a solicitor, you need to be aware of the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) "character and suitability" test. You are required to satisfy this prior to commencing a Training Contract.
Please take a look at the
SRA Suitability Test 2011
. If you have any concerns about a character and suitability issue, please
contact the SRA.
Examples of matters which the SRA will take into account include but are not limited to:
Being found guilty of an academic offence
Serious financial issues (such as bankruptcy, Individual Voluntary Arrangements or County Court Judgments
Being subject to adverse regulatory findings
Demonstrating any other behaviour that we would not expect of a solicitor (for example behaviour that was dishonest, violent or discriminatory)
Criminal offences
If you are aware of any issues which could affect your ability to satisfy this test you can apply to the SRA in advance of starting a Training Contract for a decision of your suitability. If the SRA’s decision is not confirmed prior to the LLM LPC start date, you can continue with the course but do so at your own financial risk.

When should I apply?
Our
undergraduate
and
postgraduate
course pages will show the intakes that are available and open to applications. It's best to apply early so you can secure your place and beat the rush.
Once we have received your application and supporting documents (such as qualifications or references), we will review it and contact you within 4 weeks to let you know if you have been successful or not.
Our aim is to support all students to have the best possible opportunities to succeed and so our application and enrolment deadlines are in place to ensure you stand the best chance of doing so.
Joining the programme later may harm your chances of success on your course. It is therefore vital that you take note of the dates and ensure you submit your completed application and subsequent enrolment in time.
Undergraduate and postgraduate taught deadlines
Please note some courses may have an earlier induction, teaching and enrolment deadline date.
If your course operates a gathered field or pooled admissions process there may be an earlier application date. Please check your individual course page for further details.
Due to the route to becoming a solicitor changing, we are no longer accepting applications for the LLM LPC. For September 2025 entry we will be offering an LLM SQE which is the new route to train towards becoming a solicitor. We will be releasing more information on our LLM SQE soon.
