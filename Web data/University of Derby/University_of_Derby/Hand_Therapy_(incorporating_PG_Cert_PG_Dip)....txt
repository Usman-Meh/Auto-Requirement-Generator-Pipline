This course is for qualified occupational therapists and physiotherapists working in the field of hand therapy.
Building on the competence you’ve already gained in your own professional practice, this course will enable you to continue learning, evaluating, maintaining and developing services for current and future hand therapy provision.
You’ll develop your ability to critically evaluate and reflect on your own practice in hand therapy while reviewing the theory that is fundamental to hand therapy. The course will help you to develop your understanding of research methods and research skills so that you feel empowered to improve your clinical practice. You’ll find that the course is flexible to suit you and fit around your other commitments.
You’ll be fully supported by our knowledgeable academic team, who will help you with your studies by email, phone, online or face to face tutorials. You’ll have the opportunity to attend online lectures and online study days to meet with tutors, network with peers and advance your study skills. The optional Hand Therapy in Practice module involves a block week of online teaching. As well as developing your skills, it will also give you the opportunity to interact with your peers and share knowledge and best practice.
You can choose to study an individual module as a standalone course as part of your continuing professional development, so you only need to study areas that are relevant to you if you’d rather not commit to the full course.
If you successfully complete specific modules, you’ll be eligible to apply to the British Association of Hand Therapists (BAHT) for accreditation as a BAHT accredited hand therapist provided you have completed the required clinical hours or as an Associate Member accredited hand therapist, if you have completed the clinical hours required by BAHT outside the UK.
"I chose to enrol in a Masters of Hand Therapy at Derby University as the programme provides both structure and flexibility through the use of modules that I can complete at my own pace. I am an experienced clinician but want to gain more skills in evaluating my own practice. I believe the evidence-based focus of the programme will provide me with an ability to do this."
