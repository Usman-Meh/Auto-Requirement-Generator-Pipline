You’ll explore the combination of the theory, policy and practice of criminal justice and criminology. Criminologists seek to understand the nature and impact of behaviour labelled as ‘criminal’. A key focus of our programme is the relationship between criminological theory and knowledge to real-world criminal justice policy and practice. During the programme, we analyse the complex interplay between criminology, criminal justice and social justice.  You will study crime as both an individual and broader social phenomenon, and will analyse imprisonment, probation, policing, youth justice, and offending behaviour.  We provide a wide-ranging awareness of the practical dimensions of our discipline, offering you unique insights into real world criminology in action.
You will combine this with studying history against the rich historical background of Derby and Derbyshire – an important centre for trade, religious expression, industry and enlightenment thought. Our History courses explore these key ideas and themes both within our region and across the globe. You’ll study an exciting range of modules branching from the sixteenth century to the modern day.
Academic expertise
You will develop your Criminology skills through activities such as interviewing, negotiation, decision making, research and argument, and problem-based learning, ensuring that you achieve a wide-ranging understanding of systems of criminal and community justice. The teaching team includes lecturers from a wide range of backgrounds including; probation, policing, law, youth justice, psychology, mental health and academia and we seek to maintain a balance between criminological theory and practice throughout the course.  Your lecturers engage with organisations in the local community, nationally and around the world and many of them publish in journals, textbooks and are research active.
Our History teaching is underpinned by active research and scholarship. Your tutors continue to develop their expertise through research, leading to conference papers and the publication of books and articles. This enables us to support you in your development as a student researcher.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
