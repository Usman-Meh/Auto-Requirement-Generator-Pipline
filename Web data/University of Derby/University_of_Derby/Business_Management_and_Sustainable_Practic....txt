Gain a solid grounding in the fundamentals of business management, while gaining skills for the future as industries move towards a sustainable future.
The world of business is changing at an exponential rate as companies work towards sustainability goals across net zero carbon, social responsibility and environmental sustainability, and companies will require managers of the future to have a solid grounding in how to move businesses forward whilst adapting to meet these priorities.
Our modules have the United Nations Sustainable Development goals and the UNESCO sustainability competencies embedded as part of your learning, so you’ll develop skills to be at the forefront of embedding change and responsible management in organisations. Real world learning is a key part of your studies – from working on live industry briefs, guest speakers from the business world, and the opportunity to complete a placement year between your second and third year, you’ll have opportunities to put your skills into practice before you graduate.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.

We will also support these students through information, advice and guidance, outreach activities and on-campus visits before and during the application process.
