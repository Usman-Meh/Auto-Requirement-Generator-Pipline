Does prison work? Is rehabilitation effective? How do the justice and penal systems in other countries compare to our own?
To what extent do we use media as a way of claiming and understanding identities?
On this degree, you’ll explore the full breadth of human behaviour, from how social divisions play key roles in both access to the media and modes of representation in media texts
,
to understanding crime as both an individual and social phenomenon. You’ll also build an awareness of the economic forces that frame the media, cultural and creative industries, and the role they have in areas of contemporary political and cultural life.
Boost your employability
You will have the opportunity to work with our links with local and national media organisations and employers, engaging in projects such as multiplatform advertising and content production, film festivals and screening events, public relations and promotional campaigns and media research.
You will learn how to write for different media platforms, such as journalism, promotional and PR writing, with an emphasis on digital media platforms such as web content writing, blogging and social media.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.
