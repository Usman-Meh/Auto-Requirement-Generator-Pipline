If you have the potential and ambition to study with us, but feel you’re not quite ready to join the BEng (Hons) Electrical and Electronic Engineering right now, why not consider taking this course with a
foundation year?
Electricity lights our homes, runs many of our domestic gadgets, and keeps the wheels of industry turning. We often take it for granted, yet it remains a fascinating and developing field of study – all captured in our distinctive BEng (Hons) Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
Meeting the needs of the industry and you
Engineering is such a broad discipline, and you may not fully know which area of engineering is the right choice to study when beginning your studies.
Employers are increasingly seeking engineers with a broader knowledge of mechanical and electrical engineering to meet their environmental, consumer and business needs. As a University based in an advanced engineering city, it’s vital that we offer degrees with a strong focus on sustainability, electrification and automation.
With this in mind, we have developed our degrees to match the multi-disciplinary requirements that employers are shouting for. All engineering students will take the same core modules in the first year to gain an essential foundation in all aspects of engineering, giving you the chance to settle into your studies, and allowing you time to decide which area suits you best. At the end of your first year, you’ll have the opportunity to switch to either our
BEng (Hons) Motorsport Engineering
or
BEng (Hons) Mechanical Engineering
degrees should you realise your passion falls within this area, or you can continue on BEng (Hons) Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
I have learnt the principles behind devices such as cell phones and apply those same principles in my own creations. The engaging modules and great support from staff helped me decide to focus on embedded systems and sensors for my future engineering career.

BEng (Hons) Electrical and Electronic Engineering
Use specialist facilities
Your studies will feature practical learning and experiments in our specialist laboratories. Areas include:
Electronic Principles Lab:
Featuring a range of test equipment, demonstration boards, and equipment used to conduct investigative experiments on common electronic circuits as well as more advanced systems, you’ll hone your understanding of circuit behaviour in a safe and supportive environment. The computers are also equipped with the latest simulation software from Matlab, Microchip and National Instruments
Electrical Power, Sustainable and Renewable Energies Lab:
The lab has a range of renewable technologies and a variety of DC and AC electrical machines test rigs.
Electronics Project Developments and Innovations Lab:
In this lab you’ll learn practical skills covering basic hand tools and soldering skills, as well as electronic component identification, following circuit schematics and Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layouts, simple design of PCBs, and the complete build and commission of a project
Multipurpose Lab:
This lab doubles as an experimental lab, with several permanently installed tests, and a programming suite for both audio and lighting. Our lighting simulation programme will allow you to view 3D simulations of a lighting design
Multi-Channel Sound Lab:
The Multi-Channel Sound Lab is a Dante audio equipped room containing 32 loudspeakers used for investigative future immersive audio applications
Multipurpose Lab:
Our other multipurpose lab is used for small scale audio testing. Containing a very small anechoic chamber, a vintage hearing test booth and a selection of loudspeakers in different stages of deconstruction
You'll also have access to our Makerspace - a place where you can work on any project and turn your ideas into a prototype. Equipment in the Makerspace includes a laser cutter, 3D printers, soldering irons and CNC machines. All students across the University can use this space and it is a fantastic way of sharing knowledge and skills with one another.

The timetable contains up to 16 hours of contact with staff a week, with around the same amount of time designated as "directed study".
All modules are supported through University of Derby Online (UDOL), so you have access to essential support materials at any time of the day or night.
How you are assessed
Assessment is through a careful blend of assignment and examination. Assignments may relate to work at the computer or in the laboratory, or may involve a piece of written or analytical work.

Personal Academic Tutoring
At the University of Derby, every student is assigned a Personal Academic Tutor (PAT) from the very start of their degree journey. This dedicated tutor becomes a key figure in your academic life, offering guidance, support, and insight to help you make the most of your university experience. Whether it's through one-to-one meetings or more informal catch-ups, your PAT will work with you to explore your strengths, address any challenges, and help you achieve your full potential. This relationship is designed to ensure you're not just succeeding academically, but also growing as an individual, developing the skills and confidence you'll need for your future career.
Your PAT will provide tailored advice to support your academic journey, whether that's by discussing your work, helping you set goals, or exploring career options. These regular meetings give you the space to reflect on your progress, understand where improvements can be made, and build on your strengths. At Derby, we want you to feel both challenged and supported. Your PAT will encourage you to push your boundaries, think critically about your work, and develop a proactive approach to your studies.
But it's not just about coursework. Your PAT will also help you identify extra-curricular opportunities, whether that's joining clubs, gaining work experience, or developing new skills outside of your course. These experiences not only enhance your CV but also give you the confidence to tackle future challenges. In short, your Personal Academic Tutor will be there to guide you every step of the way, ensuring you leave university with more than just a degree — but with a wealth of experiences, skills, and the knowledge that you're ready for the next chapter of your life.

Careers
When you graduate, a wide range of employment opportunities will open up for you in electrical and electronic engineering. You could move into areas as diverse as avionics, medical electronics, automotive electrical and electronic systems, electrical power generation, the rail industry or music and entertainment.
Recent students have moved into roles involving electrical or electronic system design, installation and commissioning, programming, maintenance, and related activities. Derby graduates can now be found developing embedded systems in cars, electrical power distribution systems, railway signalling systems, or rolling stock enhancements. They are also managing major industrial processes, from breweries to assembly lines.
The numeracy and problem-solving skills you develop during the BEng (Hons) Electrical and Electronic Engineering will broaden your career scope further still, with alternative options including teaching, banking, accountancy, technical sales or management.
You could also consider taking your studies to postgraduate level by taking, for example, our
MSc Control and Instrumentation.
