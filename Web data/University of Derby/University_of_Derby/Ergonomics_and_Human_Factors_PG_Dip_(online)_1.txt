The Masters in Ergonomics and Human Factors is developed in line with the CIEHF core competencies, and is a qualifying course for graduate membership.
Modules can be studied individually for your CPD
If you decide that a full Masters is not what you’re looking for just yet, we’ve designed our
online Ergonomics and Human Factors modules
, all at level 7, so that they can be completed as a short standalone course. Delivered over a 10-week term, you’ll study with the full course cohort and achieve a Certificate of Credit on successful completion of the module. So, if you are looking to build your CPD or expand your knowledge of ergonomics and human factors, then a 20 credit module is an ideal alternative.

How you will learn
This course introduces key Ergonomics and Human Factors theory and debates, and it is designed to transition you between the theoretical knowledge, research evidence and application in practice. With a mix of group work and independent study, the course entails a wide range of study materials, interactive activities, reading, reflection and assessments.
During your studies, you will be encouraged to consider the knowledge gained throughout the modules in the context of your own workplace and demonstrate your understanding back through the online discussion boards as well as your assessments.
Pace of study
The academic year is made up of three 10-week terms, known as trimesters. We recommend around 20 hours of study per week to complete one 20-credit module over a 10-week trimester for the standard study plan.
There will be 1/2 virtual classrooms over the 10 week trimester and if you are unable to attend you will be able to download the session to view in your own time.
Assessment method
This course is assessed entirely through coursework. You will undertake formative and summative assessments to demonstrate that you have met the module and programme learning outcomes.
Typically, assessments require you to integrate and critically evaluate the knowledge and skills covered in the modules with your own research and wide reading. Assessments will take the form of academic reports and case studies, online oral presentations and poster presentations through to developing or critiquing research proposals and conducting your own independent study.
Student support and guidance
Whilst we encourage our students to become independent, life-long learners, we also recognise that offering the right support and guidance will help you to achieve your goals. There is a wealth of support available to you at the University, from your dedicated Personal Tutor and Online Learner Advisor, through to our:
