These tests include body composition analysis using bioelectrical impedance, assessing body fat and lean muscle mass. Resting blood analysis involving the measurement of hematocrit and hemoglobin, key indicators of blood health and oxygen-carrying capacity,  is also included. The core assessment is the VO2 max and blood lactate assessment conducted using a two-stage protocol.  First, a step protocol gradually increases power output to identify lactate thresholds (LT1 and LT2). Second, a ramp protocol gradually increases power output until exhaustion to determine VO2 max, peak heart rate, and maximal aerobic power.
