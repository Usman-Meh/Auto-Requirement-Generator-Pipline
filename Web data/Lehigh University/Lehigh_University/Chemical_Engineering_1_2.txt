What is Chemical Engineering?
Lehigh’s undergraduate major and minor in chemical engineering combines an in-depth background in the chemical and physical sciences with classical engineering principles, preparing students for dynamic careers in a wide range of industries. Students learn science and engineering fundamentals through the use of computers, team projects and lab experiments in laboratory facilities that are among the best in the nation.
Lehigh’s program offers technical minors that provide a broad foundation in such critical technologies as environmental engineering, materials engineering, polymer science and engineering, energy, information and biotechnology.
Chemical Engineering Careers
Lehigh’s chemical engineering alumni go on to play important roles in the chemical process industry in areas such as research, development, design, plant construction, plant operation and management, corporate planning, technical sales and market analysis. They are the driving force in many exciting areas of bioengineering and biotechnology, including pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical R&D, cellular bioengineering, diagnostics, drug delivery and the large-scale processing of food and consumer products from perfume to crayons to toothpaste.
Chemical engineers are also vital in areas such as pollution abatement, national defense and homeland security, and the manufacture of microelectronic devices and integrated circuits. Their skills are uniquely attuned to the engineering of efficient energy resources, from nuclear plants to fuel cells. Chemical engineers are bringing new perspectives and approaches to meeting the world’s energy needs.
