4+1 Master of Science in Engineering
4+1 Master of Science in Engineering
4+1 Master of Science in Engineering Overview
The 4+1 format offers students the opportunity to earn a Master's in Engineering at an accelerated pace. Students accepted into the 4+1 accelerated program begin taking graduate classes during their junior and senior years and can complete the program one year after earning their undergraduate degree. Current Lehigh students who earn a minimum overall GPA of 3.5, may elect to be enrolled in the 4+1 accelerated program once they achieve junior standing - a minimum of 54 credits. Students in these programs who do not qualify for direct admittance to the MS or MPH based on their GPA must apply for acceptance and two letters of recommendation are required.
Master’s degrees are becoming increasingly common in the engineering workplace, and graduate study allows students to build new skills or expand existing ones. Students may elect to continue in their undergraduate discipline or change fields. Opportunities for study also exist in programs that reside outside of the traditional engineering departments—including building professional credentials in energy, healthcare systems, technical entrepreneurship, structural engineering, or data science.
