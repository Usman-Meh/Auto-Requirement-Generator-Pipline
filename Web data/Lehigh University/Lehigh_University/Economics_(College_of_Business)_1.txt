Economics (College of Business) Major
Economics (College of Business) Major Overview
The Economics Major provides students with a solid grounding in the basic tools and models used in economic analysis.  After mastering intermediate micro and macroeconomics, students choose from a wide range of upper level classes to learn how these tools and models are applied to vital issues such as changes in the labor market, implications of the rise of new internet-based firms, changes in financial markets, or challenges presented by pollution and climate change, among many others.  Combined with the College of Business core, this major prepares students for careers in business, consulting, non-profit organizations, or government.
