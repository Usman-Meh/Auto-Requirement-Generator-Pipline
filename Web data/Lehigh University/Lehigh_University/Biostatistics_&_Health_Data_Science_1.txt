Biostatistics & Health Data Science
Biostatistics & Health Data Science Degree
Biostatistics & Health Data Science Degree Overview
The BS in Biostatistics & Health Data Science is the pursuit and application of knowledge that advances human health through systematic data-centric methods. By conveying both public health knowledge and data and technology skills, this program prepares its graduates for impactful careers in the emerging health information economy. Students will learn how to e.g., forecast the trajectory of disease; infer the causal drivers of health outcomes; discover evidence of health disparities; make effective decisions that lead to positive outcomes across the life course; assess the impact of social structures and policies. The Biostatistics & Health Data Science program draws on knowledge from many disciplines including mathematics, statistics, computing, and epidemiology, but frames these to the singular applied objective of advancing public health. It spans hypothesis generation, study design, data collection, data storage, data processing, analytic methods development, application and interpretation of analyses, dissemination, and translation. It emphasizes rigor, reproducibility, effective communication, and ethical practices. The major is intended for students who are interested in health, healthcare, and health policy from a data focused perspective, or students who seek to acquire analytic, computational, and data skills within the context of human health.
