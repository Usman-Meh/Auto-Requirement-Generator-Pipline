Mathematics Degree Overview
Lehighâ€™s undergraduate major and minor in mathematics provides both a program in the liberal arts tradition that prepares students for a variety of careers in government, industry, and education, and one for students who plan to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics.
Mathematics is a subject of great intrinsic power and beauty. It is the universal language of science, and is essential for a clear and complete understanding of virtually all phenomena.
Careers in Mathematics
Mathematical training prepares a student to express and analyze problems and relationships in a logical manner in a wide variety of disciplines, including the physical, engineering, social, biological, and medical sciences, business, and pure mathematics itself. This is a principal reason for the perpetual need and demand for mathematicians in education, research centers, government and industry.
