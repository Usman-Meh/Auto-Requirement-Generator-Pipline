What is Mechanical Engineering?
Lehigh’s undergraduate major in mechanical engineering offers students a comprehensive education grounded in the fundamentals of the discipline while incorporating invaluable hands-on experience opportunities. Professors renowned for their research offer world-class instruction and access to research internships, co-op experiences and independent study projects. The program prepares students for satisfying and productive careers in a wide variety of fields.
Mechanical engineering students gain knowledge in areas such as solid and fluid mechanics, engineering materials, product design and manufacturing, thermodynamics and control systems. The manufacturing course required of all juniors exemplifies the department’s hands-on approach to education. Using sophisticated engineering tools, teams of Lehigh students collaborate each year with local middle-school students to design, simulate, fabricate and produce a new manufactured product, like a plastic matchbox car or a new way to package toys. They use the department’s CAD software, rapid prototyping facilities, computer numerical control milling and injection-molding machines. The course culminates with an annual expo in which the students compete and are judged on product design and effectiveness.
Mechanical Engineering Career Opportunities
Lehigh’s mechanical engineering alumni go on to design, create and operate various types of machinery. They manage systems for energy conversion, material transport and the control of motions and forces.
Mechanical engineering is one of the broadest engineering fields, with professionals working in industries as diverse as aerospace, transportation, bioengineering, communications, electronics, computers, energy, environment, machinery and manufacturing.
