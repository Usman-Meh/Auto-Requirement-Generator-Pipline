Master’s in Electrical Engineering Overview
The rapidly growing graduate program in electrical engineering is uniquely positioned to advance enabling technologies that drive revolutionary developments in nanotechnology, biotechnology, optical technologies, information and communications technologies, and sensors and sensor networks.
The program offers students a variety of research opportunities in three broad and highly integrated areas of concentration: optoelectronics and biophotonics; wireless communications, networking, and sensing; and nanoelectronics, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), flexible displays, and biotechnology research.
Electrical and computer engineering faculty maintain nationally funded programs in critical research areas such as compound semiconductor optoelectronic devices, silicon photonics, optical communications, displays, microelectronics fabrication, MEMS, bioengineering, wireless communications and networking, sensing, signal processing, code-division multiple access, and space-time coding.
