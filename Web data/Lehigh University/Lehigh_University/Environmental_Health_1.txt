Graduate Certificate in Environmental Health
Graduate Certificate in Environmental Health Overview
Students receive an in-depth, interdisciplinary overview of the ways the environment—both the built environment and the natural one—affect individuals’ physical and mental health and well-being. Access to fresh air, fresh food, clean water, and places to exercise all support healthy lifestyles and healthier lives; the lack of access to those resources as well as the proximity to problematic housing conditions or concentrations of crime can significantly undercut adults’ and children’s physical and mental health.
Through environmental health core courses and electives, students critically analyze this link between health and place, and evaluate policies and programs designed to address both environmental quality and its effect on residents.
