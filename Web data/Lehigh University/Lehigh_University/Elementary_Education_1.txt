Master’s in Elementary Education
Master’s in Elementary Education Overview
Designed for the college graduate who, as an undergraduate, specialized in a field other than education, and who can begin his or her study of professional practice at an advanced level, this 14 course (minimum) Elementary Education program prepares students for the master’s degree in Elementary Education (M.Ed.) and Pennsylvania Pre K-4 teacher certification.
The program’s focus is the development of the teacher candidate’s understanding of the aims and curricula of early elementary or early childhood schools, the purposes and methods employed in teaching all learners (including those with special needs and ELL), basic principles of research and testing, and the techniques of gathering and analyzing educational data.
