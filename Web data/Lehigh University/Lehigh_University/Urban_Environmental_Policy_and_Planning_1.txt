Urban Environmental Policy and Planning
Urban Environmental Policy and Planning, certificate
Urban Environmental Policy and Planning certificate Overview
This graduate certificate trains students to look at the way the built and natural environments—and the policies and programs that shape and affect them—impact particular places. It also examines the way those places impact the people who live, work, and visit them. Students taking Socio-cultural Foundations of Environmental Policy and three additional approved courses on urban policy, urban agriculture, city planning, or environmental justice, are eligible to receive the certificate.
