Molecular Biology Degree
What is Molecular Biology?
Lehigh’s undergraduate major and minor in molecular biology explores cells, their characteristics, parts, and chemical processes, and pays special attention to how molecules control a cell’s activities and growth.
Our curricula offer distinctive experiences that provide exceptional preparation for graduate school, professional training, and careers in health-related industries. Students are actively encouraged to become involved in independent study and honors research where they work directly with faculty and graduate students on the generation of new knowledge. Through coursework and laboratory experience, students learn to conceptualize and address scientific problems, understand professional responsibility, work independently and as part of a team, and bring an integrated, multidisciplinary perspective to bear on contemporary issues in the life and health sciences.
Careers in Molecular Biology
Lehigh’s molecular biology alumni work in fields including botany, genetics, medicine and biotechnology. While entry-level positions can be achieved with a bachelor’s degree, many students go on to graduate school.
