Master’s in Environmental Policy Overview
This interdisciplinary program is structured to give students significant flexibility in their coursework, the opportunity to receive additional certification in five subject areas (Environmental Health, Environmental Justice, Environmental Law and Policy, Sustainable Development, and Urban Environmental Policy and Planning), and the ability to complement classroom learning with more in-depth research (by completing a thesis) or practical experience (through on- and off-campus internships).
