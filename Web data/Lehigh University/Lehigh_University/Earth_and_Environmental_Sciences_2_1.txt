Master's Earth and Environmental Sciences Overview
Lehigh’s Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences aims to challenge our Master’s students to develop a broad and deep understanding of Earth systems and their components. The department’s fundamental work lies in basic research and field-based experiential education, but it also actively cooperates with other students and scholars to examine the ramifications of human interaction with the environment.
