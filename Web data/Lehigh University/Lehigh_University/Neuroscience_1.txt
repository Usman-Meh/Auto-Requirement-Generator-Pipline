What is Neuroscience?
Lehigh’s undergraduate major in neuroscience focuses on the biological basis of human behavior. The program combines the disciplines of psychology and biology to provide an understanding of how the behavior of humans and other animals is controlled by physiological systems.
The biological sciences include the study of living systems at levels ranging from the structure and function of molecules to the behavior and evolution of communities of organisms.
Neuroscience Careers
Lehigh’s neuroscience alumni work in academia, the healthcare industry, business, law, and global health, and for the government. They also go on to attend some of the country’s top graduate schools.
