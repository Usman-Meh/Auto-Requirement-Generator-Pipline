Astronomy Degree Overview
Lehigh’s undergraduate major and minor in astronomy is intended for students who desire a broad background in astronomy, mathematics and physics but do not plan to do graduate work in astrophysics.
Students who major in astronomy usually have very inquisitive minds and a good aptitude for physics and mathematics. The bachelor degree program in astronomy provides students with a solid background in laboratory and theoretical astrophysics as well as in the fundamentals of physics and mathematics. Research opportunities are available to supplement classroom instruction.
What Can I Do with an Astronomy Degree?
Lehigh’s astronomy alumni work as science writers, at planetariums and museums, and as teachers at colleges, universities and high schools.
