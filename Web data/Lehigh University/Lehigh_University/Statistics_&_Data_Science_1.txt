Master’s in Statistics & Data Science
Master’s in Statistics & Data Science Overview
The discipline of statistical sciences is concerned with the art of developing techniques to gain information and make decisions from data in the presence of uncertainty. The techniques are based on the theory and tools of the various branches of mathematics—especially probability. A graduate education in the statistical sciences allows one an entry into many areas of physical and social sciences, medicine, business, and government.
The MS program in statistics has two tracks: statistics and stochastic modeling. It requires 30 credit hours of graduate courses with at least 18 hours of 400-level STAT courses for the statistics track and at least 18 hours of 400-level STAT or math courses for the stochastic modeling track.
