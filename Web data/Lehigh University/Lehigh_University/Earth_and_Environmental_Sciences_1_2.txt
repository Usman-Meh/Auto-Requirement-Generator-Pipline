Earth and Environmental Sciences Degree
Earth and Environmental Sciences Degree Overview
Lehigh’s undergraduate major and minor in earth and environmental sciences expose students to the fundamentals in environmental science, geology, and ecology, all in the context of a modern earth-systems-science approach. The robust degree programs are aimed at helping students prepare for a wide range of possible career paths in basic and applied science as well as a larger constellation of careers in areas like law, government, and business.
The curriculum reflects the great range in approaches to studying the Earth system. It addresses the needs of both majors and non-majors who, as future citizens and leaders in business and government, will play an important role in facing issues of natural resources, hazards, environment, and energy.
Career Opportunities
Lehigh’s earth and environmental sciences alumni work in fields including engineering, environmental law, journalism, economics, government, and others.
