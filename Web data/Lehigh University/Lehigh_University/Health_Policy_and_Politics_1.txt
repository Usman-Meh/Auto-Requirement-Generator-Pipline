Health Policy and Politics
Health Policy and Politics Minor
The minor in Health Policy & Politics is intended for students interested in receiving more advanced training and experiences in healthcare policy-making processes and the political factors that influence this process. Courses introduce the theoretical and empirical approaches to understanding the different phases of the policy-making process; the important roles that politicians, bureaucrats, and civil society play in the design and implementation of policy; as well as the role of the international community, such as the World Health Organization (WHO).
Minor programs are open to all students and can complement majors pursued within Lehighâ€™s other undergraduate colleges.
