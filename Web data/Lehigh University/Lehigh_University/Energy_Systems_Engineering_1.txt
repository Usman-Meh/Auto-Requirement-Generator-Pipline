Energy Systems Engineering
Energy Systems Engineering Master’s Degree
Energy Systems Engineering Master’s Degree Overview
For students with B.S. degrees in engineering, physics, computer science, mathematics, and related fields, Lehigh’s 10-month, 30-credit professional master’s program in energy systems engineering helps students develop into organizational and technical leaders in the energy and power industries. The hallmark of the program is student immersion in hands-on, industry-driven projects. Each student will apply advanced technical knowledge and skills and work collaboratively with a team of faculty, fellow students, and representatives from sponsor firms to complete a project of impact and significance in the field—a real project as conceptualized by the project’s sponsoring researcher or industry concern.
The development of targeted research projects serves as an entry point into the field for talented young innovators, and a source for firms to explore new skill sets and solutions required for success with emerging technologies and approaches.
