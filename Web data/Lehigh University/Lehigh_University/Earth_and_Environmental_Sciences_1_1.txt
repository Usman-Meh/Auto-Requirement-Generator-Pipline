Earth and Environmental Sciences
Ph.D. in Earth and Environmental Sciences
Ph.D. in Earth and Environmental Sciences Overview
Earth and Environmental Sciences (EES) is a diverse department that blends contributions from geologists, ecologists, and environmental scientists. Its goal is to stimulate learning about the fundamental physical, chemical, geological, and biological processes that shape Earth’s natural environment. It seeks to promote understanding of Earth systems and their components by supporting geological and biological study of how these systems function and interact.
The department’s fundamental work lies in basic research and field-based experiential education, but it also actively cooperates with other students and scholars to examine the ramifications of human interaction with the environment.
