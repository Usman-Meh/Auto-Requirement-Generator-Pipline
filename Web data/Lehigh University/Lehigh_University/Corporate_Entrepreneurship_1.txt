Executive Certificate in Corporate Entrepreneurship Overview
We’re excited to have partnered with our Graduate Programs Office to offer Lehigh’s VENTUREseries program in an executive education format.
New venture creation is analyzed and dissected from the perspective of the established or developing company. These entities are committed to building new commercial enterprises to grow and remain competitive. How an organization can enhance its capability to market, organize, execute, integrate, and invest in new ventures is a constantly recurring theme in Lehigh's VENTUREseries programs.
