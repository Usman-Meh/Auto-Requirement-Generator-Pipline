Maternal and Child Health
Maternal and Child Health Minor
The Maternal and Child Health minor is a 16-19 credit program that will include core courses, such as Introduction to Population Health or Community Health, Introduction to Maternal and Child Population Health, and Lifecourse Epidemiology. Students will gain a deeper understanding of the lifecourse approach as well as the multiple determinants that shape the health and wellbeing of women, children and families across the life course and intergenerationally. Students will apply these foundational concepts to evaluate maternal and child health research, programs, and policies in the US and globally.
