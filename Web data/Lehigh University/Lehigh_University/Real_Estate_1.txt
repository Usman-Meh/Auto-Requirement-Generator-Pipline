Real Estate Minor Overview
Lehigh’s undergraduate minor in real estate prepares students to become the next generation of real estate leaders by offering rock-solid business skills, unprecedented hands-on experience, and a unique “big picture” perspective not found at any other institution.
Bringing a project to fruition often takes several years and the efforts of a vast array of professionals. To capture “the big picture,” the real estate program spans a full three to four years, allowing students to investigate a development project over the long term. This approach gives students an understanding of the entire process, how the different components fit together, and how to overcome obstacles.
The program creates leaders equipped with knowledge, vision, determination, and high ethical and social standards through ongoing mentoring, team-building activities, and constant interactions with role models drawn from both the professional and academic fields.
