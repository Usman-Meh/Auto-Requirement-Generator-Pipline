Supervisor of Curriculum & Instruction Program
Supervisor of Curriculum and Instruction Certification
Supervisor of Curriculum and Instruction Certification Overview
The Lehigh Supervisor of Curriculum and Instruction certification program builds the capacity of aspiring supervisors to work closely with school leaders to improve teacher effectiveness and thereby improve student learning. Drawing from the fields of education and management, the program equips the next generation of supervisors with expertise in instructional, supervisory, and curriculum leadership. The supervisory certification program is endorsed by the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) and allows successful program completers the ability to hold an administrative position (other than building principal) in most all PA public institutions.
Prior to receiving the endorsement from the College of Education for certification, students must submit passing scores on the PRAXIS Supervision and Administration examination and have demonstrated a minimum of five years of certificate teaching experience.
Students take 7 courses in instructional leadership, curriculum management for the school executive, organizational leadership and change management, supervision and professional development, and data-based decision making.
