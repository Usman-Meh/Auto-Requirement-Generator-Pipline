English Degree Overview
Lehigh’s undergraduate major and minor in English has emerged as a surprisingly versatile major for the 21st century because it teaches skills that are valued in today’s career environment, across a range of professions. Among the skills students learn are researching, collecting, and synthesizing information; making thoughtful claims and supporting them with arguments; writing clearly and effectively for a variety of audiences; seeing the big picture within a social, historical, and cross-cultural framework; understanding texts and interpreting complex documents; making judgments about questions of value and meaning; working with others on team-based projects; and giving constructive criticism and helpful feedback.
In addition to learning valuable skills, English majors are encouraged to read deeply and write creatively.
What Can You Do with an English Degree?
Lehigh’s English majors work for companies like Weber Shandwick, Price Waterhouse Coopers, ZenithOptimedia, Teach for America, and everything in between. They’re journalists, lawyers, teachers, public relations and marketing professionals and often pursue graduate degrees in complementary disciplines to help define their career paths.
