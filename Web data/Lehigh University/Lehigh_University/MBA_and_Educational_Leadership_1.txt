MBA and Educational Leadership
FLEX MBA and Educational Leadership, MELBA
FLEX MBA and Educational Leadership, MELBA Overview
The landscapes of both business and education are changing. In order to address the new demands by taxpayers for more fiscal and organizational accountability from school boards, administrators, and principals, the Lehigh FLEX MBA has teamed with the College of Education to offer the joint MBA & Educational Leadership.
The degree focuses on the critical skills needed to make sound decisions—budgetary, personnel, and planning—that are required in today's educational systems. It also offers the opportunity to acquire a solid foundation in both business and education. While supporting expertise in instructional supervision and training are emphasized, MELBA also provides a framework where excellent education and sound business practices can flourish.
