Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies certificate Overview
Designed as a complement to a disciplinary graduate program or as a stand-alone post-baccalaureate course of study, this certificate program is a small, flexible one that provides students with breadth and the challenge of working outside their home discipline in concentrated interdisciplinary study of women and gender.
In recognition of contemporary educational and employment contexts that are increasingly diverse and international, the Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program offers the certificate as a means to enrich academic, personal, and employment horizons. A certificate will be especially beneficial to those who wish to incorporate a broader perspective into their teaching. Additionally, individuals interested in fields such as social policy, human resources, and business will also gain from understanding how gender operates at individual, organizational, and institutional levels. Students will work closely with outstanding faculty from diverse disciplinary backgrounds.
