Pure Mathematics
Pure Mathematics Minor
What is Pure Mathematics?
Lehighâ€™s undergraduate minor in pure mathematics provides students with an understanding of the basic concepts and structures that underlie mathematics. Its purpose is to search for a deeper understanding and an expanded knowledge of mathematics itself.
In recent years, Lehigh has had approximately 10 to 15 math majors graduating each year, which means classes are small, so students get to know their professors and classmates well.
Pure Mathematics Career Opportunities
Lehigh alumni with minors in pure mathematics go on to do graduate work at some of the top schools in the country. They also work as actuaries, for financial companies, for computer companies, or as teachers.
