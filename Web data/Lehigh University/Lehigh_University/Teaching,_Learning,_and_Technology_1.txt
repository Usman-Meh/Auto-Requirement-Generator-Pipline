Ph.D. in Teaching, Learning, and Technology Overview
In this 16-course (48-credit) program, research is not separate from application or practice. Doctoral students collaborate closely with faculty to generate new theories and classification systems, innovative curricula, technology-integrated learning environments, authentic approaches to assessing learning, and a wide range of creative methods of teaching and learning in a global world highly interconnected by technology.
In keeping with the scientist/practitioner model, students learn through innovative approaches, including research-based strategies for curriculum delivery, synchronous and asynchronous environments, and a wide range of other technology-enhanced designs and approaches for learning.
