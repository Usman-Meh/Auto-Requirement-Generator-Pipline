Accounting Major Overview
Lehigh’s undergraduate major in accounting provides fundamental education and preparation in core accounting courses as well as networking opportunities that prepare students to hold leadership positions in a diverse array of business careers, often with the “Big 4” professional services firms.
The combination of a strong curriculum and talented students has earned Lehigh’s accounting program the “key school” designation by recruiters. As a result, during students' sophomore year, professional firms provide on-site summer and winter leadership programs and externships to acquaint students with career opportunities. In the following year, during the summer, Lehigh accounting majors typically participate in well-paid summer internship programs that lead to entry-level jobs upon graduation.
