What is Asian and Asian American Studies?
Lehigh’s undergraduate major and minor in Asian and Asian American Studies is an interdisciplinary program that provides students with an opportunity to acquire a systematic knowledge of Asia, specifically East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific.
The program focuses on the rich historical and cultural heritage of the countries of Asia, and is designed to accomplish three goals: to ground students in a regional language and culture, to survey various disciplines in Asian Studies more broadly, and to provide advanced research opportunities.
