What is Latin American Studies?
Lehighâ€™s undergraduate major and minor in Latin American studies are designed for students who wish to develop an understanding of a neighboring region that is of vital importance to the United States. Courses in archeology, foreign policy, history, language and literature, and politics, along with independent studies in the visual arts and museum studies allow students to explore various aspects of Latin American cultures and societies from different disciplinary perspectives.
The major and minor both offer students an international vantage point from which they can examine their own society and prepare them to meet the challenges of an increasingly interdependent world. The unprecedented movement of peoples and ideas between the American continents in recent decades makes the study of this region of the world an essential component for understanding the history and culture of the expanding U.S. Latino population.
Latin American Studies Careers
Lehigh alumni with a major or minor in Latin American studies work in policy, for nonprofits, in government, communications, and teach through the Latin American world.
