English as a Second Language (ESL) Program Specialist
English as a Second Language (ESL) Program Specialist, certification
English as a Second Language (ESL) Program Specialist certification Overview
The English as a Second Language (ESL) Program Specialist Certificate strives to enhance educators’ knowledge of linguistics and second language instructional practices, while fostering their development as teacher-advocates.
This Pennsylvania Department of Education-approved 6 course program takes 1½ to 2 years to complete on a part-time basis. Courses are offered every fall, spring, and summer in both face-to-face and online formats. It is a six-course add-on certificate for K-12 educators who are already certified or those who are in the process of getting their certification.
The program will advance educators’ knowledge and use of evidence-based instructional practices to support the learning and second language development of English learners (ELs) in K-12 schools. With the understanding that ELs often have inequitable learning opportunities, this certificate seeks to assist educators in being agents of social change in their schools and districts.
