Environmental Engineering
Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering
Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering Overview
Graduate students in Civil Engineering conduct experiments across a breathtaking range of scales, using electrokinetics, nanoparticles, sensor and communications technology, and advanced physics and mechanics while overseeing some of the world's largest and most advanced structural testing and simulation facilities.
Lehigh's structural testing facilities are the largest in North America and enable research in earthquake engineering, multi-hazard mitigation, fiber reinforced composites, fatigue and fracture, development of smart structures, shipbuilding, and infrastructure reliability, maintenance and life-cycle performance.
Graduate alumni teach in more than 60 universities worldwide and excel in private sector and government. Faculty travel the world to give advice on earthquake-resistant structures, and on flood and erosion control. Students travel to give presentations at conferences, and to conduct field demonstrations of new technologies.
