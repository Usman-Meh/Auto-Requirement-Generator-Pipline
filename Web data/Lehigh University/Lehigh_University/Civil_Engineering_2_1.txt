Ph.D. in Civil Engineering
Master’s in Civil Engineering Overview
A Master’s in Civil Engineering includes coursework, independent study and research to educate students in their field. Lehigh offers master’s programs in civil engineering as well as structural engineering and environmental engineering by the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.
The program prepares students to enter the professional world with advanced knowledge, to conduct research and development or teach. To achieve the M.S., students must complete a thesis composed of three to six credit hours, or finish a report from a research course of at least three credits. The program also includes courses in specialty areas. Those obtaining a M.Eng. degree in Civil Engineering must complete either an individual engineering project or a research report, totaling three to six credits. They can alternatively take 30 credits and abstain from the project and report. Some courses in mechanical engineering and mechanics, chemistry, chemical engineering, materials science and engineering, earth and environmental sciences and biology may also be able to be included as part of the major field in civil engineering.
