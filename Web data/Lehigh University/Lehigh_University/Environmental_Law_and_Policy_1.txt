Environmental Law and Policy, certificate
Environmental Law and Policy certificate Overview
This graduate certificate offers a credential in environmental law and policy for individuals with a background in various science, engineering, social science, and humanities fields who wish to understand the theory and practice of environmental and natural resource law at the national, comparative, or international level. It is especially valuable for those in various environmental fields who come in contact with the law in the course of their work, to policy makers at all levels of government who routinely handle legal affairs, to lawyers without specific training in environmental law, and to business people who want to know what the law says about the legality of their businessâ€™ impact on the natural environment.
The certificate can also be a preparation for further studies in law, policy, or politics or for professional positions in the private or public sector.
