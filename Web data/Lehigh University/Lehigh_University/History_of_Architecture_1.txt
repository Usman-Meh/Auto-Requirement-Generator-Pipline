History of Architecture
History of Architecture Minor
What is the History of Architecture?
Lehigh’s undergraduate minor in the history of architecture provides courses on Greek, Roman, and American architecture, architecture and the city since World War II, issues in contemporary architecture, theory of materials architecture, and 20th-century architecture.
The Department of Art, Architecture and Design’s programs and faculty share a common teaching philosophy centered on experiential learning and critical visual thinking. In the classroom, we merge traditional hands-on techniques with digital technologies, complemented by extensive training in art history and the resources of the Lehigh University Art Gallery, our nationally recognized campus museum.
History of Architecture Career Opportunities
Lehigh alumni with a minor in the history of architecture go on to graduate school and are pursuing successful careers as artists, architects, designers, museum curators and arts professionals.
