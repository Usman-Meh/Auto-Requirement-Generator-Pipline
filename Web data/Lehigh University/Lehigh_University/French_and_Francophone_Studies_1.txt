French and Francophone Studies Degree Overview
Lehigh’s undergraduate major in French and Francophone studies stresses proficiency in the French language through the acquisition of both oral and written skills with a focus on French and Francophone culture and literature.
The French language is spoken on all five continents. A major language in world diplomacy, it is also the working or second language of many international organizations such as the United Nations and the European Union.  Knowledge of the French language and culture is an invaluable asset in careers in international relations and politics; journalism; African, Middle Eastern and North American Studies; and literature and the arts, to name just a few.
