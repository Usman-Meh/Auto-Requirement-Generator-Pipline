Master’s in Psychology Overview
At Lehigh, the M.S. degree in psychology is typically awarded to students who are working toward the Ph.D., although the department will also consider well-qualified students who wish to attain the M.S. as their terminal degree. The program will provide students with a broad-based understanding of such topics as cognitive psychology; developmental psychology; social cognition; statistics and research methodology, among others. Additionally, all students can expect to be engaged in research during their time in the program.
