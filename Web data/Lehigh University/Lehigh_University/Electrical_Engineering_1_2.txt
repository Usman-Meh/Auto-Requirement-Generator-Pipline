Electrical Engineering Degree Overview
Lehigh’s undergraduate major and minor in electrical engineering covers a broad set of specialties and offers numerous opportunities for engineering design and hands-on learning experience. Students receive multidisciplinary training and learn analytical thinking skills, which they can apply to problems in circuit design, electronic and optical components, sensors, biomedical devices and diverse systems, including microelectronic, control, information, computer and communication systems. They are prepared to meet the challenges in this rapidly evolving field by mastering electrical engineering fundamentals, creative problem-solving skills and newly emerging technologies and their applications.
The program is founded upon a faculty of gifted researchers who make teaching a priority, and it provides dynamic opportunities for students to work on research projects with professors and engineering professionals. Students work alongside talented faculty who lead cutting-edge research efforts in nanotechnology, optoelectronics, fiber optics, flexible displays, microelectronics fabrication, bioengineering, information and communications technology, wireless networking, signal processing and image compression.
Career Opportunities
Lehigh’s electrical engineering alumni are innovators who go on to design operating room equipment; control airplanes, missiles, and satellites; create faster ways for computers and individuals to communicate; make vehicles faster and safer; and create and control new renewable sources of energy. They use nanoelectronics, tiny computer chips and photonic devices to harness clean, alternative sources of energy, create biomedical instrumentation that saves lives, and develop sensor networks that protect the environment and improve quality of life. They provide the technological leadership to solve tomorrow’s societal problems.
Lehigh’s electrical engineering program provides students with the tools necessary to solve complex problems in technology-related fields and also medicine, finance, law and government. A solid foundation in how to think and how to solve multidisciplinary problems using mathematics, science and engineering prepares students to excel in almost any career.
