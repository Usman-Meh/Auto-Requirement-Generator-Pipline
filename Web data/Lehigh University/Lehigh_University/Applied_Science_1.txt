What is Applied Science?
Lehigh’s undergraduate major in applied science enables students to create interdisciplinary specialties that prepare them for careers in a world that increasingly bridges academic disciplines. Students pursue subject-area concentrations that represent academic interests they wish to integrate into a meaningful program. The core offers students the intellectual tools to identify connections between the concentrations and engage in interdisciplinary problem-solving and critical thinking.
Each student’s curriculum combines a general engineering education with a carefully customized concentration in engineering and/or science as well as another area of emphasis.
Applied Science Careers
Lehigh’s applied science alumni work in fields including technical communications, digital media, entertainment science, education, law, medicine, technology management, technology marketing, engineering and architecture.
