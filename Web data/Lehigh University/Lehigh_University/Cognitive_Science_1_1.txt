Cognitive Science certificate Overview
The cognitive science graduate certificate program focuses on the study of minds and brains, be they human or animal, real or artificial. Researchers study how people, other animals, and computers perceive, understand, learn, and act. They try to understand the fundamental nature of intelligence and how it arises from material substances. They ask how understanding human intelligence can improve the performance of machines, and how intelligent machines can augment human thought. They study how cognitive functions develop, and how they break down when brains or machines are damaged.
Cognitive science is inherently interdisciplinary, bringing together methods and discoveries from psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, anthropology, philosophy, and computer science.
