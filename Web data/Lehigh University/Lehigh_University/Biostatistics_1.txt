Biostatistics Minor
The Biostatistics minor provides quantitatively oriented students with conceptual knowledge and hands-on skills in applied statistics and data science techniques commonly employed in the field of biostatistics. The curriculum seeks to prepare students to interpret and contribute to quantitative research in health-related fields, including community and population health. The minor serves to broaden student employment possibilities post-Lehigh while making them more competitive as applicants to health-related graduate programs that favor prior training in applied statistics.
Minor programs are open to all students and can complement majors pursued within Lehighâ€™s other undergraduate colleges.
