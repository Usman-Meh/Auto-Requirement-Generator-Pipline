Management Major
Management Overview
Management is the art and science of helping individuals achieve goals together, often in business organizations. The Management major introduces management principles, theories, and experiences to students who want careers in management; who want to be leaders in organizations, small or large.
The Management major at Lehigh University, featuring renowned research scholars and educators, is designed to give students the knowledge and abilities required to succeed in Management Consulting, Human Resources and Organizational Management, as well as those required to embark on an Entrepreneurship and Innovation trajectory, emphasizing the development of skills in diagnosing business problems, formulating solutions for markets and firms, and effectively communicating recommendations.
We take the perspective that beyond just intelligence and technical skills, what differentiates effective managers is their understanding of the human side of business: They develop and coach individuals and teams, and they ensure individual and group behavior positively influences an organizationâ€™s performance and structure.
