Superintendent Letter of Eligibility Program
Superintendent Letter of Eligibility
Superintendent Letter of Eligibility Overview
Our PDE approved post-graduate Superintendent Letter of Eligibility program is designed for K-12 administrators seeking certification to excel in a superintendent role. The program emphasizes leadership skills while providing theoretical knowledge and practical instruction. PDE required field hours and an internship to experience the role of the superintendent are also required. Individuals will take 6 courses (18 credits) and also complete 4 courses (10-credits) that comprise an apprenticeship. These course requirements are designed to align with the Pennsylvania Inspired Leaders Standards and with the nationally recognized ISLLIC standards. In addition to these requirements, the Pennsylvania Department of Education requires that a candidate have completed a minimum of five years of successful administrative experience at a state approved school or district and be a United States citizen in order to receive Pennsylvania Superintendent Letter of Eligibility.
