Music Degree Overview
Lehigh’s undergraduate major and minor in music provides students with musicianship skills, analytical tools, individual instruction, and performance opportunities. The department promotes musical literacy through exposure to a significant body of music wherein compositions can be viewed as integral works of art and as reflections of the culture and era in which they were conceived. It develops students’ creative application of these skills and knowledge through composition, performance, and research projects.
Students choose among five different concentrations: performance; history and literature; theory and composition; jazz; conducting.
