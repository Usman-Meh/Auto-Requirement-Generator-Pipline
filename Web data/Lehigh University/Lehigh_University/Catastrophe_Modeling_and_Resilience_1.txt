Catastrophe Modeling and Resilience
Master’s in Catastrophe Modeling and Resilience
Master’s in Catastrophe Modeling and Resilience
The Master's Degree program aims at providing a comprehensive training for the professionals of this growing and rewarding sector, focusing on engineering, but including aspects of data science, actuarial science, and social sciences. Graduates of the program will have a broad understanding of the many facets of catastrophe, risk, and resilience modeling, and deeper knowledge in a selected aspect and field of application, such as infrastructure resilience against disasters, forecasting of epidemics, or probabilistic modeling applied to engineering and science. Graduates of the programs will be ready to be hired by private companies in the (re)insurance sector, catmodeling firms, and general consulting firms focusing on resilience assessment. Moreover, they will be sought after for positions in the public sector, in emergency management agencies, local administrations, and government agencies, among others.
The program is hybrid and can be completed in one year or take more time, depending on the other duties of the student. It includes six required courses (spanning catastrophe modeling, resilience assessment, data science, numerical methods, and actuarial science), three elective courses from a broad portfolio that covers various fields of application to natural hazards and public health, and one free elective course.
