Master’s in School Counseling
Master’s in School Counseling Overview
This master’s degree prepares students to provide culturally responsive direct services to individuals and groups, and conduct workshops, classes, consultation, and prevention programs across developmental levels to assist in developing coping skills for living in a complex and culturally diverse society. Internships are normally conducted in urban school districts. This program requires the completion of 16 courses (48 credits) and is based upon Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) standards and competencies for school counselors (PreK-12).
The faculty seeks to produce counselors who can conceptualize and intervene in preventative, developmental, and therapeutic ways to assist a broad cultural cross-section of individuals to improve their understanding, adjustment, and daily functioning across the life span.
