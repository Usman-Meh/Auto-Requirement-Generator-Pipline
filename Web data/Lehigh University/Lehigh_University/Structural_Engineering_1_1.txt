Structural Engineering
Ph.D. in Structural Engineering
Master’s in Structural Engineering Overview
Lehigh’s structural engineering program is internationally recognized. Graduates of these programs have the knowledge and analytical problem-solving capabilities to lead and innovate within multi-disciplinary teams for technologically complex environments such as large structural systems of the civil infrastructure.
Sponsored research is conducted in the following areas: advanced structural materials and systems, earthquake resistant structures, infrastructure hazard mitigation, intelligent infrastructure systems, simulation, measurement and evaluation of new and in-service structures, and infrastructure reliability, maintenance and life-cycle performance.
The ATLSS and Fritz Laboratories provide an ideal testing environment for academic, industrial, and government projects. Here researchers observe the expected (and unexpected) implications of analytical studies under actual or simulated conditions. Researchers, designers, and builders also study prototypes of new designs, research models, and structures that have deteriorated from use.
