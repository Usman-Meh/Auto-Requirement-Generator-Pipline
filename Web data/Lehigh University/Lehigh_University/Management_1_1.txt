Master’s in Management Overview
Designed for students with a non-business undergraduate degree, the Master of Science in Management (M2) paves the path from college to career by building a business skill toolbox that helps students define career goals, sharpens their business acumen, and provides them with the experiential learning that sets them apart.
Course work focuses on the core areas of business management and includes accounting, finance, statistics, management, economics, and marketing. Graduate faculty use lecture, case studies, and classroom discussion. The program culminates with a capstone course that ties together all the learning and concepts with a hands-on business simulation. A focus on continual exposure to personal and professional development is central to the program.
