4+1 Master of Public Policy
4+1 Master of Public Policy
4+1 Master of Public Policy Overview
The 4+1 Master of Public Policy (M.P.P.) degree may be attractive to students who desire to join the workforce in a policy analysis, administrative, leadership, or managerial capacity. The 4+1 format offers students the opportunity to earn a Master of Public Policy at an accelerated pace. Students accepted into the 4+1 accelerated program begin taking graduate classes during their junior and senior years and can complete the program one year after earning their undergraduate degree. Current Lehigh students who earn a minimum overall GPA of 3.5, may elect to be enrolled in the 4+1 accelerated program once they achieve junior standing - a minimum of 54 credits. Students in these programs who do not qualify for direct admittance to the MS or MPH based on their GPA must apply for acceptance and two letters of recommendation are required.
The program combines coursework, professional development, and independent research to build skills in qualitative and quantitative analysis; grant writing; and analysis of complex policy environments. Students will become better prepared to address normative political questions; apply statistical methods to policy analysis; and network in political and non-proﬁt sectors. The M.P.P. can be completed in a single calendar year (fall, spring, and summer)
