History Degree Overview
Lehigh’s undergraduate major and minor in history provides education in the human experience over time. The array of topics covered include: modern masculinity in American sports, religious conflict in the European Enlightenment, Jewish and Nazi ideologies of the 20th century, North American colonial religion, politics of Latin America and the Spanish world, the making of the African Diaspora, and the ages of technology and medicine.
Small class sizes and the opportunity for individualized instruction allow students to establish important professional relationships with a distinguished research faculty.
