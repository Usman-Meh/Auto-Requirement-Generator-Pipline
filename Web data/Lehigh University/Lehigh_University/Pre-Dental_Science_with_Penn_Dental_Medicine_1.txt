Pre-Dental Science Degree Overview
Lehighâ€™s undergraduate major in pre-dental science, in cooperation with the School of Dental Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, offers an accelerated program that enables selected students to earn a combined baccalaureate and dental degree after a minimum of seven years of study at the two institutions.
The program includes three academic years during which time credit hours are earned toward the baccalaureate degree. The next four years are spent in the regular program of dental education in Philadelphia.
