Computer Science and Business Honors Program Overview
Lehigh’s undergraduate computer science and business honors program is a joint initiative between the College of Business and the Department of Computer Science and Engineering in the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science. CSB students enroll—and are assigned faculty advisors—in both colleges. Students completing this demanding program are awarded a unique joint degree from both colleges. It equips students with the high-tech and business skills they need at a time when the boundaries between the two fields are becoming increasingly blurred.
The program is the only one of its kind to be accredited in both computer science and in business. Students obtain the skills and training needed to understand business functions and business-related problems, to analyze business-user information needs, to design computer-based information systems and to implement systems solutions in business organizations.
