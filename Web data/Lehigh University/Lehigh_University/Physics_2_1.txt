Master’s in Physics Overview
The Lehigh graduate program in physics is designed mainly to lead to a Ph.D. degree, and most students who enter who enter the Ph.D. program with a bachelor’s degree also earn a master’s degree. Some students structure their program with a specialized focus so that they are prepared for employment when they complete the program, but others treat it as a part of the core program for the Ph.D. track. Students in the M.S. program must complete either a research project or a Master's thesis to earn the degree.
