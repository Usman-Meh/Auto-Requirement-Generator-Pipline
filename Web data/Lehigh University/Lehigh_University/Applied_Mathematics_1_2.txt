Applied Mathematics Minor
What is Applied Mathematics?
Lehighâ€™s undergraduate minor in applied mathematics provides students with a mathematical education as it pertains to use in science, engineering, business, computer science, and industry.
In recent years Lehigh has had approximately 10 to 15 math majors graduating each year, which means classes are small, so students get to know their professors and classmates well.
Applied Mathematics Careers
Lehigh alumni with minors in applied mathematics work in financial and insurance companies as analysts, in computer companies as programmers and hardware developers, and in many different fields as researchers, as well as in academia.
