Entrepreneurship Minor
Entrepreneurial Thinking
Lehighâ€™s undergraduate minor in entrepreneurship is designed to be accessible to students from all disciplines and colleges and emphasizes innovation, entrepreneurial thinking and creative processes, cross-functional integration, and hands-on experiential activities. The minor leverages a broad array of programs and infrastructure across the university including resources made available through the Baker Institute for Entrepreneurship, Creativity, and Innovation, and the
Lehigh@NasdaqCenter
.
Students are encouraged to participate in all types of entrepreneurship, including new venture, corporate, technical, and art entrepreneurship but also not-for-profit contexts aiming for social, cultural and environmental change. Throughout the multidisciplinary, team-based curriculum, students are encouraged to work either on their own for profit or nonprofit entrepreneurial pursuits, projects related to Lehigh University intellectual property, or ideas brought in by outside entrepreneurs or change advocates.
Entrepreneurship Careers
Lehigh alumni with a minor in entrepreneurship run their own businesses, work in research and development groups of major corporations, are tasked with innovation based initiatives in both small and large businesses, drive major changes in education and public policy, and fill financial advisory roles in venture capital funds and business accelerators.
