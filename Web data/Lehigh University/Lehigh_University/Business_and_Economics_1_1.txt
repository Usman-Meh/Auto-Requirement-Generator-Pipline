Ph.D. in Business and Economics
Ph.D. in Business and Economics Overview
Relying on a balanced approach to both research and teaching, Lehighâ€™s Ph.D. in Business and Economics program focuses on the fields of health, labor, industrial organization, applied macroeconomics, and applied econometrics. It aims to prepare students for careers at colleges and universities, non-academic research organizations, business enterprises, and government agencies. In addition to the core requirements from a traditional program, there is increased emphasis on the application of economic theory and econometrics.
Only seven to nine students are admitted every two years to the selective program. As a result, classes are small and students are able to work closely with faculty.
