Chemical Engineering
Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering
Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering Overview
Chemical engineering is a broad discipline that employs tools from chemistry, physics, mathematics, and biology to carry out molecular transformation of low value raw materials to high added final products in a cost-efficient, safe, and environmentally benign fashion. Due to this broad-based training in the application of the basic sciences, chemical engineers who graduate from Lehigh go on to play important roles in research and industry.
They enjoy careers in chemical and petrochemical processing, biopharmaceutical, materials and electronics manufacturing, energy generation and distribution, environmental remediation, process automation, and more recently, in new product design.
