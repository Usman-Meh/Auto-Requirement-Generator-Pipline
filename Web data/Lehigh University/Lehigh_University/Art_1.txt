Art Degree Overview
Lehigh’s undergraduate major in art introduces students to the basic media of art such as drawing, sculpture, painting and photography.
A major in art may focus on museum studies or graphic design, or it can be combined with psychology for those who seek a career in art therapy; with theater for those interested in costume design; or with architecture and theater for those interested in set design. A major in art and minor in education is available for students interested in becoming public school art teachers.
Careers in Art
Lehigh’s art alumni have gone on to show their work at galleries around the country and teach at all levels, from elementary school through university.
