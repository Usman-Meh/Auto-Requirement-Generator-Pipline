Ph.D. in Psychology Overview
The graduate program in psychology is a selective, research-intensive one that focuses on cognitive, developmental and social psychology. The department accepts mainly Ph.D. students who obtain a masterâ€™s degree in the process of working for the doctorate, but every year a few well-qualified students may also be accepted for a master of science degree.
The faculty often work closely with researchers from other departments, programs, and colleges, including the Health, Medicine and Society Program, the Cognitive Science Program, as well as the Colleges of Business and Education. Many labs also collaborate with researchers at other institutions.
