Art History Degree
Art History Degree Overview
Lehigh’s undergraduate major in art history introduces students to the study of works of art as they relate to the historical and cultural contexts in which they are produced. Students are exposed to a broad range of artistic production, from antiquity through the present, and to the varied intellectual concerns and methodological approaches that characterize the discipline.
Because the discipline of art history approaches the study of works of art from diverse concerns and interests, students learn to use evidence from the study of history, religion, economics, politics, literature, and gender studies. The major trains students in critical thinking and analytical skills that provide an excellent foundation for careers or further study in the field, as well as for a wide range of other professional and educational options.
Art History Careers
Lehigh’s art history alumni go on to jobs in art galleries, museums, and other cultural institutions, or to graduate study in art history. Others have gone on to successful careers in such fields as law, business, and medicine.
