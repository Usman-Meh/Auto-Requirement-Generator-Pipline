MBA and Master of Public Health Dual Degree Program
MBA and Master of Public Health Dual Degree Program Overview
Public Health has come to the forefront of policy development both in government and private business. The recent COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for public health and government officials, as well as stakeholders in private business, to coordinate and define policy to improve education, awareness, and public safety in the context of defending the population against an advancing threat. The Lehigh University 1-MBA/MPH will develop expertise and skills in business and management and apply them to solving crucial issues in health and healthcare.
