French Minor
French Minor Overview
Lehigh’s undergraduate minor in French studies stresses proficiency in the French language through the acquisition of both oral and written skills.
The French language is spoken on all five continents. A major language in world diplomacy, it is also the working or second language of many international organizations such as the United Nations and the European Union.  Knowledge of the French language and culture is an invaluable asset in careers in international relations and politics; journalism; African, Middle Eastern and North American Studies; and literature and the arts, to name just a few.
French Minor Career Opportunities
Lehigh alumni with minors in French work as teachers, as translators, in policy and in government.
