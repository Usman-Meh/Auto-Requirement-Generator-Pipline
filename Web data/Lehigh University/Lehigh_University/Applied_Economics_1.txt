Master’s in Applied Economics
Master’s in Applied Economics Overview
Business school economics programs focused on the master’s level are rare. Lehigh’s College of Business offers a Master of Science in economics that features intimate interaction with professors and colleagues with very small class sizes. The program is recognized for its top-quality instruction by faculty who have won university teaching awards and whose research is current and relevant.
Students have the opportunity to supplement their educational experience with elective courses in finance, international relations, engineering, political science, mathematics, or marketing. While the focal point of this program is on the M.S., there is preparation for optional Ph.D. matriculation.
