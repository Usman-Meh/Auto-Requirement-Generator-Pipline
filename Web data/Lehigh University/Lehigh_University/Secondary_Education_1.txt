Master’s in Secondary Education
Master’s in Secondary Education Overview
The Secondary Education program is designed for the college graduate who specialized in a field other than education and seeks to become a teacher certified to work with students in grades 7-12. The prospective educator can earn either a Master of Education or a Master of Arts while attaining 7-12 certification from the Pennsylvania Department of Education.
Master’s candidates work with innovative faculty in Lehigh University’s College of Education to become highly skilled in the best practices and effective methods for teaching all learners, including those with special needs and English language learners.
The degree requires the completion of 11 courses (33 credits.) Full-time students with content-area prerequisites can complete the program within 18 months. Students can choose from eight subject areas in which to be certified to teach in grades 7-12: Biology, Chemistry, Earth and Space Science, General Science, Physics, English, Mathematics or Social Studies. They will graduate with Level 1 Teacher Certification in Pennsylvania in one of those subjects. Some students opt for dual certifications, for example, in an academic subject and special education.
