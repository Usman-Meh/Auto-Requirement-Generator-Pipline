Probability and Statistics
Probability and Statistics Minor
What is Probability and Statistics?
Lehigh’s undergraduate minor in probability and statistics provides an education in one of advanced mathematics’ basic tenets. Among the concepts covered are basic combinatorics, random variables, probability distributions, Bayesian inference, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and linear regression.
In recent years, Lehigh has had approximately 10 to 15 math majors graduating each year, which means classes are small, so students get to know their professors and classmates well.
Probability and Statistics Career Opportunities
Lehigh alumni with minors in probability and statistics work in financial and insurance companies, computer companies, and in many different fields as researchers, as well as in academia.
