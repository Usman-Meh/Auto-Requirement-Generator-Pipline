What is Physics?
Lehigh’s undergraduate major and minor in physics provides an education in the basic laws of mechanics, heat and thermodynamics, electricity and magnetism, optics, relativity, quantum mechanics, and elementary particles. Students also study applications of the basic theories to the description of bulk matter, including the mechanical, electric, magnetic, and thermal properties of solids, liquids, gases, and plasmas, and to the description of the structure of atoms and nuclei. In addition, students develop the laboratory skills and techniques of the experimental physicist, skills that can be applied in the experimental search for new knowledge or in applications of the known theories.
Career Opportunities for Physics Majors
Lehigh’s physics alumni go on to work in research roles, education, automotive and aerospace industries, defense, the public sector, healthcare, energy, materials, technology, computing and IT.
