History of the Visual Arts Minor
History of the Visual Arts Overview
Lehighâ€™s undergraduate minor in the history of the visual arts enables students from non-art majors to form an understanding of the role that art plays in human history and culture. The minor includes required courses on the history of art and architecture, as well as options including 20th-century art, women in art, and an introduction to museum work.
History of the Visual Arts Career Opportunities
Lehigh alumni with a minor in art history have gone on to graduate school, to jobs in fields related to their majors, or to jobs in art galleries, museums and other cultural institutions.
