Master’s in Instructional Technology Overview
Lehigh University’s Master of Science degree in Instructional Technology gives students the tools to incorporate a diverse range of technology in learning and instruction, whether they are working in K-12 schools, higher education, or the business world. Master’s candidates learn how to integrate instructional technology more effectively in a variety of contexts, such as in classrooms, corporations, and non-profits, as well as how to effectively design, implement, and evaluate their technological integrations. The degree requires the completion of 10 courses (30 credits) offered in person, online, and in hybrid options, including summer institutes that are intensive eight-day courses. Typically, it takes one to three years to finish, depending on whether students are full-time or part-time.
