Joint International Relations and Modern Languages and Literatures Degree
Joint International Relations and Modern Languages and Literatures Degree Overview
Lehigh’s undergraduate major and minor in joint international relations and modern languages and literatures recognizes that Lehigh graduates must be adequately prepared to play an active role in the world of the 21st century. For that, they will need an acute understanding of essential issues of global politics, broad linguistic and cultural skills, significant overseas experience, and both intellectual and cultural sophistication.
This major meets those requirements with courses in economics, international relations, language, and culture. Extended study abroad and undergraduate research in more than one language are also required. The program helps students develop a deeper and richer understanding of cultural, linguistic and political diversity around the world.
