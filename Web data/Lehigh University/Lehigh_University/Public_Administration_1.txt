What is Public Administration?
Lehighâ€™s undergraduate minor in public administration provides students with an education in Constitutional principles; the organization and operation of the national government; and dynamics of power within the U.S. political system.
It also presents the intellectual history of the study of public administration in a manner that is intended to inform career choices for those who might consider public service and provide a broad introduction to the field of public administration. Students gain a comprehensive perspective on the public administration discipline by exploring the pervasive puzzles, ethical dilemmas, and critical issues in governance to date.
Public Administration Careers
Lehigh alumni with a minor in public administration work in public policy, for local and state governments, for the national government, and in other fields.
