4+1 Elementary & Secondary Accelerated Master's Program
4+1 Elementary & Secondary Accelerated Master's Program Overview
The College of Education offers a five-year degree program that is designed to allow students to earn a bachelor's degree in the major of their choosing, a master's degree in Elementary or Secondary Education, and a Pennsylvania Teacher Certification in five years instead of the traditional six. Lehigh is accredited by the Pennsylvania Department of Education to certify elementary general education teachers in grades PreK-4 and to certify secondary general education teachers in grades 7-12 in specific content areas: Biology, Chemistry, Earth and Space Science, General Science, Physics, English, Mathematics, and Social Studies. Students traditionally align their BA or BS towards these areas of certification. Students may apply to the 5 year program at the end of their freshman year.
