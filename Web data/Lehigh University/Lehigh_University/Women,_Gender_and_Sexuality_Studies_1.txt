Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies Degree
Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies Degree Overview
Lehigh’s undergraduate major and minor in women, gender and sexuality studies is an interdisciplinary field of academic inquiry that critically examines gender and sexuality from an intersectional model that takes into account the manner in which class, race and power co-constitutively shape and impact gendered and sexed identity construction.
In the best tradition of a liberal arts education, women, gender and sexuality studies encourages thinking that is critical and constructive, multifaceted and intersectional in order to redesign knowledge and gain a better understanding of how identities shape and are shaped by the social world in which we live. Women, gender and sexuality studies works to be a space of professional growth and intellectual development and maturity, and a knowledge leader on campus, in the surrounding Lehigh Valley, and abroad.
