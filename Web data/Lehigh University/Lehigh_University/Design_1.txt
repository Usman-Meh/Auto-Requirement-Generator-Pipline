Design Degree Overview
Lehigh’s undergraduate major in design engages students with new technologies, materials and media in developing the creative processes and critical thinking necessary for the modern designer. The major centers on studio with an emphasis on visual communication through digital media. Courses in art and design history and theory and in specific media techniques supplement the series of required studios.
Students can take a range of department courses in design or may choose a specific concentration in either graphic design or product design. The graphic design concentration introduces students to the tools and media related to print applications, web-based media, exhibition design, publishing and advertising. Product design concerns the creation of objects used in industrial applications, art objects, furniture, toys, exhibits and trade design, electronic products, household items and recreational equipment.
Career Opportunities
Lehigh’s design alumni work in interior design, film and television production, fashion design, editorial roles in printed media, sub-editing, product and packaging design, advertising, and landscape gardening.
