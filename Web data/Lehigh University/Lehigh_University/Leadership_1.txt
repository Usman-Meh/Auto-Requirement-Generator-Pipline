Executive Certificate in Leadership
While most companies agree that talent is their most important asset, they aren’t investing enough in development. Whether for individuals identified as high potentials by their organization, or for individuals who choose to advance their own career, the Executive Certificate—the most popular offered by Lehigh—provides comprehensive education in business acumen and leadership. It is formal recognition and acknowledgement of a strong commitment to professional development.
