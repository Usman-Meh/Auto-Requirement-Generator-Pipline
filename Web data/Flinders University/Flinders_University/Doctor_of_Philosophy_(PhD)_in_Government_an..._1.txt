Reconceptualising sustainable development
Supervisors
:
Associate Professor Cassandra Star
Learn more
Business interests have appropriated sustainable development discourse, leading to negative environmental and economic impacts on communities. The prioritisation of corporate interests in policy has led to an increase in inequality both within and between countries.
Alternative conceptions of `progress´, and `development´ must be considered as they better serve community rather than corporate interests. This project considers the implementation of biocentric alternatives to mainstream sustainable development, including the Latin American concept of
buen vivir
which translates to ‘living well in community’.
