Public Health
Overview
Explore and redefine public health practice to promote health in light of contemporary knowledge.
The courses are founded on a commitment to the advancement of quality and integrity in multidisciplinary practice, and principles of equity, inclusiveness, promoting health and disease prevention, accountability and community participation.
The courses create opportunities for health professionals to examine workplace issues and to formulate new ways of addressing them and putting them into practice in order to reduce inequalities in health care access and health outcomes. The teaching and learning focuses primarily on helping health professionals change their practice in light of new insights. Topic assignments may be related to workplace issues and problems.
