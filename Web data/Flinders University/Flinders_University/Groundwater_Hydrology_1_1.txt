Groundwater Hydrology
Overview
The postgraduate groundwater hydrology program enables scientists, engineers and other environmental professionals whose work requires groundwater knowledge to complete a professional and industry-focused study of groundwater hydrology. You will gain a wide understanding of hydrological processes and phenomena, including but not limited to groundwater. Other associated topics teach you the critical interrelationships groundwater has with surface water hydrology and vegetation, amongst others.
Our strong postgraduate groundwater hydrology teaching program is complemented by a leading research program for the training of PhD by research students.
Flinders University is an international leader in groundwater hydrology education and research, and was rated 13th globally for water resources research in the 2019 Academic Ranking of World Universities.
Flinders University is a key partner in the National Centre for Groundwater Research and Training (NCGRT), which is located on the Flinders campus.
The NCGRT provides strong links with industry and access to a large range of expertise not otherwise available, with numerous leading state and federal agencies such as CSIRO Land and Water, the Department of Environment and Water, and other partners.
