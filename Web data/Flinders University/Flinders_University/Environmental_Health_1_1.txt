Environmental Health
Overview
Environmental health is the study of how the environment impacts on our health – the physical, biological, chemical and sociological factors external to us that determine our health and wellbeing. Environmental health is the branch of public health that is concerned with all aspects of the natural and built environment that affect our health, such as water, food, air, buildings and waste.
The postgraduate courses in environmental health aim to provide you with the professional qualifications to enter or enhance career opportunities in the area of environmental health. This pathway program provides you with advanced knowledge in the theory and application of environmental health and environmental health risk assessment.
Both programs cater for national and international students through the teaching of globally relevant concepts and through the opportunity to undertake risk assessment and applied research in the environmental health area within Flinders University or their existing workplace.
