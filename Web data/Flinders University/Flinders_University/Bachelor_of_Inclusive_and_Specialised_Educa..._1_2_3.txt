The Bachelor of Inclusive and Specialised Education (Early Childhood) recognises the importance of inclusive education in today’s society, and the need for teachers with specialised expertise when teaching
learners
with diverse needs.
Our students are guided through the development of knowledge, skills and attributes that will empower them to teach in inclusive education classrooms and specialised settings. They will learn evidence-based strategies to support all learners in gaining access to participate and progress with their learning whilst establishing learning environments that promote positive wellbeing. In addition to becoming literacy and numeracy specialists, students will graduate from this course with the agency and confidence to apply and adapt their knowledge and skills across a range of contexts, working effectively with all learners in contemporary schools.
As an Initial Teacher Education degree, successful completion of the Bachelor of Inclusive and Specialised Education enables you to apply for registration with the Teachers Registration Board of South Australia.
