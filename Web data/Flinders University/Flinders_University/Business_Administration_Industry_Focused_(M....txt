"The MBA program at Flinders has given me immense confidence along with the tools, skills and knowledge to take the next steps in my career.

Manoj Sai, Master of Business Administration
Learn more
In 2018, Sai Manoj began postgraduate studies as the inaugural winner of the Flinders University BW Business World Scholarship. Flinders launched the scholarship at the Australian High Commission in Delhi in 2017, to find India’s next
Game Changer.
Sai was selected from a large pool of applicants from right across India.
Sai Manoj’s already impressive Bachelor of Engineering (Mechanical) and Masters Diploma in Mechanical Product Design and Analysis will be bolstered by the (approximately) $65,000 scholarship, leading him towards a Master of Business Administration.
"I hope to combine my knowledge in engineering and working experience with my MBA program to come up with innovative ideas and business opportunities”.
Flinders’ MBA is accredited by the prestigious Association of MBAs (AMBA), which provides the global standard for all MBA degrees. Flinders University is the first South Australian university, and only the third in Australia, to receive accreditation.
For Sai, the opportunity to further his studies at Flinders has been a game changer.
“Studying an MBA in a developed country and gaining global exposure has been a long-standing dream of mine. Winning this scholarship has changed my life in its truest sense. Not only has it given me immense confidence, it has also opened doors to new perspectives and opportunities”.
Flinders’ MBA is teaching Manoj the fundamentals of business design, and is giving him insights into the principles of sound business practice. Hands-on experience at Flinders’ New Venture Institute will give Sai the opportunity to explore innovation and entrepreneurial thinking. The New Venture Institute was created to link individuals, businesses, educators and researchers, in order to help them thrive, create and innovate in today’s demanding business environment.
“I am a businessman and an aspiring entrepreneur and this scholarship has lifted a huge financial burden from my shoulders, thereby enabling me to be my natural self and continue to take risks which I feel is quite important for businessmen and entrepreneurs alike”.
Flinders University has one of the most flexible MBA programs in Australia, with world-class credentials. Sai Manoj’s scholarship will give him the tools, skills and knowledge he’ll need to take the next steps on what is already an exciting career path.
“With the things I learn here, I hope to expand my business into other fields and hopefully establish a strong, ethical, and a sustainability centric brand committed to making a positive change”.
What you will study
The Graduate Certificate, Graduate Diploma and Masters courses provide a structured pathway containing 16 topics.

You can also choose an industry placement instead of one core topic. And you could also extend your industry exposure by electing to undertake an industry entrepreneurial program: the Wine and Tourism Entrepreneurship Program or the Advanced Manufacturing Entrepreneurship Program.
You will also undertake a major industry project which will bring together everything you have learnt over the course and put it into practice.
