What you will study
The Master of Speech Pathology consists of 72 units.
The program is highly integrated and comprises three streams of study:
professional studies and communication sciences
speech pathology skills and practice
research methods.
In the professional studies and communication sciences stream, the content is delivered via problem-based learning tutorials. It involves working through a weekly case study in small groups facilitated by a tutor, and followed up with independent learning. These case studies are also supported by lectures and other learning resources. The case studies cover the areas of professional practice: speech, language, voice, fluency, swallowing and multimodal communication. These areas are considered in relation to lifespan development and socio-cultural context and how they impact health and well-being.
In the speech pathology skills and practice topic stream, you are allocated to work-integrated learning placements under the supervision of placement educators. Regular clinical skills tutorials on campus support development of skills and knowledge.
The research methods stream aims to ensure you become familiar with evidence-based practice in the discipline of speech pathology. It also supports you to understand, critique and apply research methodology, so that you are an informed consumer of research, can use it to inform your practice and are able to develop an understanding of yourself as a practitioner-researcher.
Students will undertake professional experience placement as part of the course. For more information visit
