Sustainable Development
Help create a sustainable future with South Australia’s only postgraduate degree in Sustainable Development.
How have the actions of humans impacted the world? What can we do to at present to guarantee a sustainable future?
Climate change. Poverty. Population growth. Gender equality. These are the most concerning topics of the 21st Century. The actions of humans have posed some of the most compelling and fraught challenges.
Understanding the legacy of these challenges and solving these problems requires both knowledge of ecological and physical processes, and insight into the cultural, demographic, economic, geographical and political aspects of development and human-environment connections.
A postgraduate degree at Flinders in Sustainable Development will equip you with the knowledge, skills and tools to help create a sustainable future, with real impact by answering real questions, from real topics that need answers.
Sustainable development explores the development process across three sectors – society, economy, and the environment - in the context of both developed and developing countries. A core pillar of this degree is exploring the 17 Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations, which is a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future. Developing a critical awareness and knowledge of the Goals and their applications are crucial for careers in public, private and non-governmental sector organisations that operate in in the field of development.
You’ll learn from industry, and leading academic staff, and graduate with a powerful mix of interdisciplinary skills to solve a range of problems. You’ll analyse and synthesise complex environmental, economic, social and political information to identify and plan appropriate development solutions and contribute to debates about human-environment relationships.
