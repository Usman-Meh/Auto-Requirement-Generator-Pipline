Marc Fairhead
Bachelor of Archaeology (Honours) '21
“
The amount of time that I got to spend in the community, particularly in the aboriginal communities, was pretty special. I got to volunteer on various projects and got to slow down and just take in the broader society we live in. I worked with Community on Adnyamathanha, Jawoyn, Kuuku I’yu and Ngadjuri Country as well as the River Murray and Mallee Aboriginal Corporation on various joint cultural heritage projects.
Coming from overseas, I chose Flinders because I wanted to specialise in Archaeology. Flinders is the only university that has a dedicated degree and not just a major in an arts degree."
