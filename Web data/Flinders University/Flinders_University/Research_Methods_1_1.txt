Research methods
Overview
The Graduate Diploma in Research Methods is an intensive, one-year qualification designed to provide you with in-depth knowledge of research methods and your subject area as a pathway to a higher degree by research. It includes a substantial 18-unit research thesis/project (one semester/six months) and the research methodology topics that provide the comprehensive research knowledge for applicants who do not otherwise have the research experience required to apply for entry into a higher degree by research.
This course can be pursued in both the College of Business, Law and Government or the College of Education, Psychology and Social Work.
By studying within a specific college of the University, you are provided with expertise and support that is directly relevant to your chosen area of study.
