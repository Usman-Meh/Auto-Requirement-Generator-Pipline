Teaching (Birth to 5)
Overview
Teach children aged birth to 5 years.
This course brings together theory and practice, preparing you for a career in early childhood settings – such as long-day childcare centres, kindergartens and preschools. You'll gain the skills and knowledge to effectively plan, implement and advocate for transformative teaching and learning for children aged birth-to-five years.
You’ll learn how to enact policies and practices that take account of social and individual differences, ensuring that all children learn in supportive and just environments. Plus, you'll engage in inquiry-led and research-based projects, construct and assess play-based learning for children, and gain an understanding of the importance of all children learning about, and through, indigenous ways of knowing and being.
Whether you hold an undergraduate degree and are looking for a new opportunity, or already working in an early childhood setting and want to build on the skills you've developed in your Diploma of Early Childhood Education, this is your chance to discover a rewarding career in the early childhood teaching profession.

What you will study
First year
A typical first year may include:
The first year introduces pre-service teachers to foundational aspects of pedagogy and practice, including historical and contemporary approaches to teaching young children. The importance of play is explored, alongside the benefits of diverse play opportunities for children's learning and development. Making Meaning in the Expressive Arts explores how children make sense of their world through expression and representation. Pedagogies of Belonging delves into children's social and emotional development through work integrated learning opportunities. The Developing Numerate and Literate Infant explores children's early understanding of numeracy, and the importance of language whilst working with babies and toddlers. The year finishes with a 25-day placement in a metropolitan or country early childhood setting.
Second year
A typical second year may include:
The second year of study focuses on pre-school teaching and learning, through Thinking and Working Scientifically in the Early Years, Reading and Writing Through Play; and The Numerate Child. Playing on Country focusses on nature play and bush kindergarten, connecting to indigenous ways of knowing and being whilst playing outside. Teaching and learning through technologies, and children's health and physical education are explored; and pre-service teachers complete a final 40-day placement spent in a metropolitan or country early childhood setting.
Practical experience
This course includes extensive work integrated learning opportunities, and professional placements in both the first and second year that meet the professional and employment requirements of the early childhood sector in South Australia.
Practical experience requirements
Child-Related Employment Screening
All College of Education, Psychology and Social Work pre-service teachers must obtain a Working With Children Check (WWCC) from the Department for Human Service (DHS) Screening Unit and a Responding to Risks of Harm, Abuse and Neglect: Education and Care (RRHAN-EC) from a registered provider before undertaking their professional experience placements. This is a requirement of the Department for Education (DfE), in agreement with the Catholic Education and Independent Schools Boards. Pre-service teachers who are not cleared will therefore not be able to complete the requirements of the course.
Instructions about applications are provided on the
professional experience website
