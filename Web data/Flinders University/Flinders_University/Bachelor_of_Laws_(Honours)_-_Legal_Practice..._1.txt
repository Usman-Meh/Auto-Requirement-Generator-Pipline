“
Flinders University provides such practical experiences, that you just can't compare with other courses. I still remember our first year Torts topic, which required us to interview a "client" - who was, in fact, a drama student - to retrieve as much information as we could about her circumstances, and then draft advice based on the information we received during the interview. I felt this was such a wonderful assignment, and it put me in a fantastic place when I commenced practice..
