“
I can see myself using the knowledge and skills I’ve been taught throughout my degree in a whole bunch of ways.
From all of the things I didn’t expect to be learning, plus all the areas that I am really excited about. I think the industry itself is so broad and there are so many different roles and jobs available that I can tailor what I’ve been studying to where I expect to be going.
Abbey Paton, Bachelor of Creative Industries (Festivals and Arts Production)
