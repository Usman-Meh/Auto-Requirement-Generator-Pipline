Medieval and Early Modern Studies
Choose a major in Medieval and Early Modern Studies
Games of thrones, cultural encounters, social upheavals – find out how medieval and early modern civilisations changed the world.
Medieval and Early Modern Studies (MEMS) is a flexible, cross-disciplinary major or minor designed to advance knowledge of the medieval and early modern worlds from the fifth to the eighteenth centuries. Crossing national, political, imperial, cultural, social, gender and disciplinary boundaries, MEMS at Flinders gives students the historical and literary understanding and analytical skills necessary to understand our own interconnected, globalised world. You will learn about the revolutions and major transformations that changed the world and influence our world even today, from military and industrial, political and societal, health and economic, urbanisation and empires, and how all these changed cultures and societies across the world. The program draws on the expertise of members of the College of Humanities, Arts & Social Sciences from multiple disciplines, namely English, History and Archaeology, encouraging students to choose their program of study at upper levels according to their own interests.
