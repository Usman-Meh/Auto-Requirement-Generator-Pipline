Practical experience
Practical hands-on experiential learning starting from first year is at the heart of our student-centred learning approach to support medical science learning. Students use cloud-based learning during physiology practicals, learn microscopy and visualise the human body up-close using real-life human tissue samples and high-definition digital specimens, and further engage in team-based learning with peers to understand and solve problems in advanced human molecular genetics.
Study abroad
There are opportunities to take your studies overseas for a semester as long as the topics align with the course curriculum.
