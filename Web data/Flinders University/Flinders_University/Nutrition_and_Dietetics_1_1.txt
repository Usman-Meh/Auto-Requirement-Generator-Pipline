Nutrition and Dietetics
Overview
Undertake advanced studies in nutrition and dietetics, the pathophysiology of nutrition-related illnesses, health promotion, communication skills, and clinical, food service and community and public health nutrition skills.  This program aims to prepare students for professional practice as nutritionists or dietitians. Graduates will be able to work across a variety of settings to integrate and apply advanced theoretical knowledge, skills and attributes to promoting health, and preventing and treating diet-related illnesses.
Graduates are able to use scientific principles and critical thinking skills to consider the wider environment affecting food supply and eating behaviours and to evaluate new developments in this rapidly evolving area.
The course is offered by Flinders University’s College of Nursing and Health Sciences and is founded on practices designed to encourage lifelong learning in the practice of nutrition and dietetics. A wide variety of teaching and learning strategies are employed, including lectures, tutorials, field placements, site visits, food practicals and student seminars and presentations.
A variety of assessment methods is used, including peer and self-assessment and competency-based assessment of field placements. Particular emphasis is given to the provision of practice-focused learning strategies (eg. case studies, role-plays, simulated counselling and group sessions).
Consistent with the postgraduate level of the course, cooperative and self-directed learning will be encouraged and you will have the opportunity to negotiate sections of curriculum learning strategies and assessment in some topics.
