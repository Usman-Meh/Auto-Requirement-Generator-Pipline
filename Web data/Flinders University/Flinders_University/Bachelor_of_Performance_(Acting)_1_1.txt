Hear from our students
“
One of the first things that struck me was the wide variety of teachers that we have and that they are all still currently practising in the industry. You know that the teaching you’re getting is applicable to the industry right now and what you’ll be doing as soon as you leave. The course has been constructed so it really builds year on year, from learning foundations to learning in-depth about specific skills.
Being in a room of like-minded people all week with your shared passion for acting creates a space to explore, grow and learn together without judgement. Flinders really offers the best and most intensive all-around course in SA, so it was always my first preference. It is the only university that maintains rigorous training and puts practical rehearsals first. There is a fantastic legacy of past graduates who have gone on to do amazing things and are such an inspiration for students like me.
