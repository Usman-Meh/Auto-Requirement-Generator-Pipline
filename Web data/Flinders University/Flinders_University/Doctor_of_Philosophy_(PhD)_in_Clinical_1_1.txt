Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Clinical
Undertake a PhD in Clinical
FHMRI champions the work of our researchers in the most important way: by facilitating the flow of new knowledge to the community.
At the Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute (FHMRI) our clinical researchers work to develop and implement new methods for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease to improve health. This is facilitated by their co-location with Flinders Medical Centre and private hospital, and strong partnerships with rural and remote communities.
Through your PhD research in Clinical, you will have the opportunity to work on clinically relevant projects that enhance understanding about healthy ageing, blinding eye conditions, heart and vascular disease, sleep disorders, and many other diseases.
