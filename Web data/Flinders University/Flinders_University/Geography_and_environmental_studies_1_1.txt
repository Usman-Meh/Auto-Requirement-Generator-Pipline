Geography and environmental studies
Choose a major in Geography and Environmental Studies
Make sense of the world.
Geography explores the dynamic relationships between people and cultures, the natural and built environments that shape us. A major in Geography makes sense of the world by recognising connections, distribution and characteristics of various social and biophysical processes, and by asking where, at what scale, and why the world is the way it is. It examines contemporary issues like social and environmental justice and the efficient, equitable and sustainable use of resources. You’ll be introduced to different ways of knowing the world—drawing on the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities. You’ll develop transferable skills in computing and written, oral and graphic communication.

“
Learning about the connection between people and the environment, especially within different spots throughout South Australia is fascinating to learn. My main interest is how different cultures and people interact differently with different environments and also how much they value these environments. This degree lets me really take an in-depth look into what interests me.
The staff here at Flinders are super supportive. I went to a different university prior to coming here, and what I have found is that the staff really support you, get to know you on a more personal level and give you whatever assistance you need. This, combined with the more natural campus creates a much better learning environment."
