Remote Health Practice
Overview
The Remote Health Practice program aims to meet the higher education needs of health professionals working in remote areas and supports the transition to remote practice for those who have an interest in joining the remote health workforce.
Health professionals are challenged to advance their knowledge of the discipline of remote health and develop the necessary skills for working within the remote and Indigenous context to improve health outcomes of remote and Indigenous populations.
This articulated program was developed in collaboration with CRANAplus and is offered in online mode through Flinders University, Alice Springs campus.
Up to 80% off fees due to Government subsidies*.
