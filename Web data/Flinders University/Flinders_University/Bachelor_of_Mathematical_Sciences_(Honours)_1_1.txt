Why study Mathematical Sciences at Flinders
The course features innovative assessment beyond quizzes and tests, which will develop your skills in communication, problem-solving, research and even how to use artificial intelligence (AI)
Study a collection of topics from a chosen second area within science, computing or engineering, such as computer science, biology, physics or chemistry to broaden your skills
Undertaking a unique industry placement where you’ll be embedded in a company or organisation solving a real problem while you study
Strong future employment growth predicted, with 1800 new graduates needed over the next five years (ANZSCO ID 2241, Labour Market Insights)
Ranked No.1 in SA in Science & Mathematics for learner engagement, learning resources, skills development and student support (The Good Universities Guide 2024 (undergraduate), public SA-founded universities only).
Your career
Demand for mathematics graduates is strong, as mathematics is essential to a range of industries including science, engineering, technology, medicine and business, and in areas as diverse as linguistics, political science and ecology. With a degree in mathematics, you can apply your skills to any field you are interested in.
Because of the wide range of uses, there are few jobs labelled simply “mathematician” and instead there’s a wide range of jobs that employ people with a degree in mathematics under different names. These call for people with skills in critical thinking, problem-solving, modelling and describing data.
The range of jobs available to maths graduates can be seen in the
MathsAdds guide
produced by the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute. This collects real job add that a graduate in mathematical sciences could apply for.
Potential occupations include:
App developer
Artificial intelligence developer
Cryptologist
Data scientist
Defence scientist
Financial analyst
Fraud analyst
Mathematician
Modeller
Marketing analyst
Researcher
Statistician.
Potential employers include:
Advanced manufacturers
Australian Bureau of Statistics
Banks and accountancy firms
Bureau of Meteorology
Defence Science and Technology Group
Research centres
Tech companies
Universities.
Professional accreditation/recognition
Graduates working in mathematics can apply for accreditation from the Australian Mathematical Society
Graduates working in statistics can apply for accreditation from the Statistical Society of Australia.
What you will study
First year
A typical first year may include:
core topics covering calculus, statistics, and professional skills
elective topics from across the University.
Second year
A typical second year may include:
core topics in extending your skills in multivariable calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, numerical methods and probability
elective topics from across the University.
Third year
A typical third year may include:
core topics with advanced study of differential equations, modelling, complex variables, partial differential equations, and statistical science
an industry placement working on a real-world problem
elective topics from across the University.
Honours year
A typical honours year may include:
an in-depth honours project on a problem or area of mathematics or statistics
advanced topics on mathematics or statistics.

Practical experience
The Bachelor of Mathematical Sciences (Honours) not only provides the knowledge and skills needed to apply mathematics to modern problems, but also gives you the chance to do this while you study. You will undertake an industry placement with a company or organisation working on a real problem using your mathematics or statistics.
Students complete a WIL placement in a relevant industry.
Learn how applied mathematics is used in professional settings to solve real-world problems.
Develop advanced research, communication and technical skills.
Honours Year
An honours year is a fourth year of study (or part-time equivalent) in addition to the standard three years in a bachelor degree. Completing an honours year demonstrates that you have an advanced understanding of mathematical sciences, providing additional employment pathways or the possibility of entering postgraduate degrees.
During your honours year, you will study advanced topics in mathematics or statistics that extend both your knowledge and critical-thinking skills. These topics typically bring you to the leading-edge of mathematical science, ready to apply these skills to complex problems, including in industry or in new mathematical research.
During an honours year, you will complete a large project while working one-on-one with an expert in mathematics or statistics from Flinders University. This project will be a detailed investigation into a single problem or application, allowing you to demonstrate both your mathematical and communication skills. An honours project shows potential employers that you have the capacity to produce high-quality work over an extended period of time. You can see a list of current projects available on the
Student Projects site
