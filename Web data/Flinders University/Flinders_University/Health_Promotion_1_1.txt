Health Promotion
Overview
The Graduate Certificate in Health Promotion aims to provide you with the knowledge and skills to incorporate the principles of public health into specific fields of practice in order to reduce inequalities in health care access and health outcomes.
In Australia, these principles include:
maximising consumer and community participation to enable individuals and communities to be better informed and to be involved in health care decisions
encouraging partnerships between health and non-health sectors to ensure full use of resources
fostering self-management and self-reliance to increase knowledge, skills and confidence in individuals, groups and communities
promoting health and disease prevention to attain and sustain good health and well-being.
Up to 80% off fees due to Government subsidies*.
*Government subsidies enable Flinders to offer Domestic applicants a reduction of up to 80% off full course fees through Commonwealth Supported Places. Offer subject to change.
