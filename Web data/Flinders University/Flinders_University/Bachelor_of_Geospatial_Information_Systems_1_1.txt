Bachelor of Geospatial Information Systems
Study Geospatial Information Systems at Flinders
Create a career mapping the complexity of our world.
In this degree, you’ll be taught skills to support change, growth and analytics in areas like global warming, urban planning, mining and exploration, archaeology, transportation and biodiversity management. You will integrate field-based data acquisition with modern technology, computer workshops and classroom-based theory.
Geospatial Information Systems (or GIS) is a sector that is expanding rapidly and being increasingly integrated into almost every discipline. GIS focuses on systems designed to create, manage, analyse, and leverage all forms of geographic data. The Bachelor of Geospatial Information Systems produces graduates capable of capturing, analysing, and managing spatially related information in a variety of locations from land-based and drone technology to advanced Earth observation platforms.
