What you will study
The Master of Science (Mathematics) consists of two years of full-time study. Students entering with a bachelor degree in the same discipline will be eligible to apply to follow a 54-unit pathway.
The course has flexibility to allow you to choose topics that both complement and extend your undergraduate studies. It offers studies in all areas of the mathematical sciences, with an emphasis on modern applied mathematics. You can select studies in areas such as methods of applied mathematics, complex analysis, partial differential equations and statistical science.
