Graduate roles include community education officer, and education and engagement officer.
Potential occupations include:
teachers in school classrooms
school coordinators and principals
curriculum and policy advisers in departments of education
advisers to government departments and other policy makers.

What you will study
The Master of Teaching (Secondary) consists of 72 units over 1.5 or two years. The 1.5 year version is taken as 45 units in the first year and 27 units in the last semester as a full time load, while the 2 year equivalent is taken as 36 units per year.
The study program includes an introduction to teaching and research in the education profession, researching learners and learning, and relationships for learning and teaching.
Curriculum topics will deal with understanding and developing curriculum in context in the middle years of school as well as senior years specialisations, and assessment in education.
Topics will discuss differentiation and inclusive educational practices, teaching Indigenous Australian students as well as professional issues in secondary education, and the reflective professional in action. Literacies and numeracies for the middle and secondary years and ICT will be covered. The program will include the required professional experience placements with preparation lectures and preliminary work
Practical experience
You will be engaged throughout the entire program in developing the skills to become a teacher. The course includes blocks of professional experience in the first and subsequent year as required by the Teachers Registration Board of South Australia.
Practical experience requirements
Child-Related Employment Screening
All College of Education, Psychology and Social Work pre-service teachers must obtain a Working With Children Check (WWCC) from the Department for Human Service (DHS) Screening Unit and a Responding to Risks of Harm, Abuse and Neglect: Education and Care (RRHAN-EC) from a registered provider before undertaking their professional experience placements. This is a requirement of the Department for Education (DfE), in agreement with the Catholic Education and Independent Schools Boards. Pre-service teachers who are not cleared will therefore not be able to complete the requirements of the course.
Instructions about applications are provided on the
professional experience website

The Master of Teaching is a pre-service teaching degree and admission normally will not be granted to applicants who already hold a teaching qualification. Selection is based on academic merit.
Additional entry requirements
Applicants must complete a non-academic assessment task known as a Teaching Capabilities Statement as part of their application to demonstrate their motivation to teach, their strong interpersonal and communication skills, willingness to learn, resilience, self-efficacy, and strong organisational and planning skills.

Inherent requirements
The Australian Government has introduced the Literacy and Numeracy Test for all initial teacher education (ITE) students to ensure they have the high level of personal literacy and numeracy skills required of teachers.
The test is a national instrument designed to assess elements of an individual's literacy and numeracy skills and will be used to demonstrate that ITE graduates are in the top 30 per cent of the population for literacy and numeracy.
All students graduating from any ITE course in South Australia must have achieved the standard for both the literacy and numeracy components of the Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education (LANTITE) to graduate.
