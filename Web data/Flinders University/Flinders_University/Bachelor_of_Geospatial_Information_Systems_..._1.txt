Why study Surveying at Flinders?
The only Surveying UG degree in South Australia
You’ll be in demand with demand for surveyors and spatial scientists expected to increase; current estimates say surveying and geospatial completions need to increase 117.1% to 920 people per year to meet future demand over the next decade.*
Gain practical experience and develop on-the-job use of a range of relevant digital technologies in our dedicated Spatial Information Systems Laboratory
*(Determining the Future Demand, Supply and Skills Gap for Surveying and Geospatial Professionals: 2022 - 2032 January 2023 report).

You'll rub shoulders with architects, engineers, planners, land developers, conveyancers, and solicitors, all working together on noteworthy projects—both local and global.

Surveyor in areas such as:
Environmental management
Urban and regional planning
Human geography and environmental health
Land-use dynamics
