Leading Mental Health and Wellbeing (Workplace and Community)
Overview
Gain the skills to lead mental health and wellbeing in workplaces and communities. Learn how to lead for change: to promote mental wellbeing, develop yourself, support those experiencing difficulties, and mitigate risk by designing for mentally healthy workplaces and communities.
The Graduate Certificate in Leading Mental Health and Wellbeing (Workplace and Community) is designed to help workplaces and communities thrive, by building the capacity of leaders, staff and volunteers to enact evidence-based mental health and wellbeing practice.
Unlike other mental health qualifications that primarily focus on mental illness (often within a medical-health framework), this program takes a broader perspective, equipping participants with skills and knowledge to implement strategy (and lead by personal practice) within organisations or community to reduce the risk of mental ill health and foster mental health and wellbeing.
Up to 80% off fees due to Government subsidies*.
*Government subsidies enable Flinders to offer Domestic applicants a reduction of up to 80% off full course fees through Commonwealth Supported Places. Offer subject to change.
