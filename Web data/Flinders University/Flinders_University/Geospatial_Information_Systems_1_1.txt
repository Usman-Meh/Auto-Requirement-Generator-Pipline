Geospatial Information Systems
Overview
The only Geospatial Information Systems postgraduate courses in South Australia.
The postgraduate program for Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) is the only GIS stream available in South Australia. Blending the disciplines of science, computer science, data analytics, geography and cartography, GIS is a fascinating and powerful area of study which allows you to impact the world around you – from using drones to survey and photograph potential areas for environmental conservation, using location intelligence and data to address racial inequities, to helping plan our future cities and genuinely improve lives.
The program provides a theoretical and practical framework for graduates from a range of backgrounds, as well as those from the public sector and non-government organisations wishing to extend their choice of career path by acquiring knowledge and skills in the capture, analysis and communication of spatially referenced information. You will develop and implement GIS skills and knowledge applicable to a range of areas, such as environmental management, urban and regional planning, human geography and environmental health, land-use dynamics, natural resources management, ecosystem services, biological sciences and archaeology. Students completing the Master of Geospatial Information Systems will be able to undertake research and analysis using spatially-referenced data and prepare research reports applicable to various fields of GIS application.

What you will study
You can select from a range of geospatial topics to build a study program that suits your interests and current or future employment requirements. The program is specifically designed to provide flexibility to students with different levels of GIS and remote sensing experience and skills. Specifically, the program allows students who have already completed undergraduate introductory topics in GIS or remote sensing to complete more advanced topics in these areas, while also providing an entry level for those who have no GIS experience.
Practical experience
You will gain GIS and remote sensing skills and knowledge that are fundamental to scientists across all disciplines and spatial landscapes. Globally relevant concepts taught in the GIS program include spatial data capture and input protocols, database structures, spatial analysis, modelling and communication practices. The concepts and research skills gained by students in these areas are highly applicable across disciplines and transferable worldwide.
