Maritime Archaeology
Overview
The Graduate Program in Maritime Archaeology at Flinders is the top named degree of its kind in Australia. You’ll learn practical skills in the classroom and gain valuable, career-ready experience in the field, with field schools and training led by award-winning, internationally recognised experts in maritime and underwater archaeology.
Get hands on in the lab with the latest digital technology, including 3D recording of artefacts and landscapes, marine geophsyics, conservation and diverse topics from historic shipwrecks to ancient submerged landscapes. Participate on archaeological projects interstate and overseas and obtain field experience through formal training in our field schools and practical topics. In the Masters Program, you’ll graduate with theoretical and practical training with an option to become a qualified Scientific Diver enabling you to participate on many scientific and archaeological projects around the world.
Careers in maritime archaeology are steadily growing, both in Australia and internationally. The Flinders program has drawn students from many countries (Australia, New Zealand, Brunei, Sri Lanka, Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Japan, UK, USA, Canada, South Africa, Italy and the Netherlands) and graduates now work professionally for underwater cultural heritage management agencies, museums and consultancy companies, as well as studying and teaching at universities all over the world.

What you will study
The program enables you to select from a range of topics covering the theory and method of maritime and underwater archaeology. In addition, a broad selection of topics in archaeology and related disciplines, such as geophysics or heritage management, are available. You can undertake fieldwork in both maritime archaeology and a number of archaeological contexts. Students without a background in archaeology may be required to complete extra study in archaeology.
Topics cover areas such as maritime archaeology in Australia, seafaring in the ancient world, and maritime archaeology field school.
Practical experience
Students will have an opportunity to learn in both a classroom and field environments. Our annual field schools have been organised throughout Australia as well as internationally through the UNESCO UNITWIN Network for Underwater Archaeology, in which Flinders is a full Member and former Network Coordinator.
Student internships are available in collaboration with government underwater cultural heritage management agencies and museums. Students are encouraged to participate in field-based learning throughout their degree as well as by making use of our international networks, to enrich their education in the field and the classroom.

Michael Ng
Master of Maritime Archaeology
“
The scientific diver micro-credential course has greatly benefited me. It helped me refine my existing skillset as an underwater archaeologist and allowed me to practice these skills in a safe yet challenging environment.
The course armed me with a range of competencies to execute underwater tasks in varied conditions as a scientific diver. The teaching method and instructions ensure that these skills are ingrained into muscle memory, which I feel is essential for working in underwater conditions."
