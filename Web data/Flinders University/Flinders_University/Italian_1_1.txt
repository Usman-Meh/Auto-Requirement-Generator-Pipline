“
Continuing Italian at university is one of the best decisions I have made.
I have enjoyed engaging with the language and the culture at a deeper level amongst other similarly passionate people and from a highly enthusiastic and intelligent teaching team. Learning Italian has broadened my global understanding and has enhanced my understanding and appreciation of languages as a whole as an important facet of the diverse state we live in.
