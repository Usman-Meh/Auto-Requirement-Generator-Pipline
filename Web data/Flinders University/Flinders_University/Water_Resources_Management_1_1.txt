Water Resources Management
Overview
The program aims to train students to understand the scientific problems involved in the management of water.
Our nested postgraduate program in water resources management is designed to meet students from different disciplines at their point of educational need and provides real flexibility both in terms of content and modes of delivery.
The program offers the possibility to produce either a degree of significant depth or a much broader program with generalised understanding of a wide range of water resources management subjects.
Students are able to combine options to emerge with skills varying from integrated water management, surface and groundwater hydrology, public health aspects of water quality, to administration and leadership skills relevant to the sector.
Hence, we train you to apply management fundamentals to solve current problems and to anticipate, mitigate and prevent future problems in the area of water resources management. You will learn to recognise and appreciate social, political, economic and environmental impacts on water resources management and last but not least to communicate effectively both orally and in writing.
As Flinders University is home to the National Centre for Groundwater Research and Training, the largest centre specialising in groundwater education and research in the southern hemisphere, the water resources management program taps into this expertise.
Our water resources research group belongs to the best in world; we are number 13 in the world in the Shanghai Ranking.
