Study Accounting at Flinders
Thrive in the financial, consulting and accounting sectors.
Accounting is a powerful tool to ensure stability and accountability for people and businesses across the globe. Regardless of size, structure or purpose, businesses are now responsible for more - rightfully accountable for everything from operational integrity, ethical spending, workforce wellbeing and their impact on the environment.
Develop the expertise and competencies to adapt and thrive in the fast paced financial, consulting and accounting sectors. Accredited by CPA Australia and the Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, this degree provides a strong foundation in accounting principles and processes, management accounting, business law, economics, finance, computer information systems, auditing, and taxation law, international accounting developments and standards, and current issues in financial reporting. You'll also learn to think beyond the traditional definition of accounting: focusing on sustainability, principled practices, new technologies, Indigenous impact, and the ever-changing future of the industry.
