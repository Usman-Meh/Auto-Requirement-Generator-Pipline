Undertake a PhD in Nursing or Midwifery
Help be the change and create better care and better systems.
There are a large range of exciting PhD opportunities aligned to the ground-breaking Flinders Caring Futures Institute, Australia’s first fully-dedicated research organisation for the study of self-care and caring solutions leading to better lives, better communities, better care and better systems across the population’s lifespan.
Our team is part of the Flinders Caring Futures Institute, working with leading organisations, professionals, community partners and people with disability to pioneer outcome-driven research that makes a positive impact on people’s lives.
Through our research in Nursing and Midwifery, we aim to help facilitate change and positively influence health care practice, leading to better health across the lifespan. We drive innovation and policy development, shape healthcare practices, and address the complex challenges faced by the global community.
We support diversity and warmly welcome applications from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander candidates and those with lived experience of disability or marginalisation.
Health Care and Social Assistance is Australia’s largest industry and is projected to have strong employment growth through to November 2026.*
