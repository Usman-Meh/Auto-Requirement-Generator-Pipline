Public Policy
Overview
The Master of Public Policy provides a multidisciplinary perspective on the global, national, and local levels of a rapidly changing policy environment.
The specialisation in public policy is designed to prepare policy leaders to master the fundamentals of public policy making - developing policy from start to finish, including analysing the problem, interpreting data, and undertaking professional research.
Tailor your degree depending on your career goals; you can choose electives from public administration, international relations, or you can select two electives from anywhere across the university.
These courses are flexible, and designed for 100% online, in person, or blended learning (a combination of in person and online classes).
Flinders University also offers the Master of Public Administration which equips the managers and administrators with knowledge and skills required to effectively manage the business of the government, not-for profit and international organisations and the Master of International Relations, which enables leaders in foreign affairs, defence or international trade to develop skills around security, economics, trade and diplomacy.
