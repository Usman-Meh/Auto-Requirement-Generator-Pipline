Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Health Emergencies and Health Security
Undertake a PhD in Health Emergencies and Health Security
Help society to prepare, respond and recover from natural and manmade hazards and disruptive events that produce new challenges for our health sector.
Worldwide, health emergencies, including disaster events, novel disease outbreaks and deliberate attacks on communities, are challenging the capacity and capability of our health systems. Health security is an increasingly important focus for those charged with protecting our communities from the impact of these natural and man-made threats to health.
A PhD provides the opportunity to deepen specialised/advanced theoretical and practical knowledge and skills in disaster health management and/or health security, to apply these in a range of situations, and to contribute to the current and future development responses to health emergencies globally.
