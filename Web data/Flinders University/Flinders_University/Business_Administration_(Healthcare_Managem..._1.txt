What you will study
The Graduate Certificate, Graduate Diploma and MBA courses provide a structured pathway containing 16 topics. There is flexibility in the course but generally students undertake 8 business and management core topics, four elective topics and four topics relevant to healthcare management.
First year (and the Graduate Diploma) contains study in human resource management, marketing, economics, finance, ethics, sustainability, and the law. Second year introduces health and aged care operations, health and aged care systems and policy, and leading organisations in health and aged care.
You can also choose an industry placement instead of one core topic. And you could also extend your industry exposure by electing to undertake an industry entrepreneurial program: FOMENT (a wine, viticulture and tourism program), or the IMA (Innovative Manufacturing Accelerator).
You will also undertake a major industry project which will bring together everything you have learnt over the course and put it into practice.
