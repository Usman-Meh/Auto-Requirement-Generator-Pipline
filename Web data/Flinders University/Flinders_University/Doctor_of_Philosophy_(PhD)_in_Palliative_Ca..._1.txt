Make a difference when it matters most.
Death and dying is a part of everyone’s life. Through our palliative care research, we support health professionals and health systems in delivering care as well as empowering the community to recognise and support individuals and families who are facing the reality of dying.
There are a range of exciting PhD opportunities aligned to the Research Centre for Palliative Care, Death and Dying, that explores the universal experience of death and dying and champions the contribution of palliative care to the person the health professional and the health system.
The Research Centre for Palliative Care, Death and Dying supports diversity and warmly welcomes applications from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander candidates and those with lived experience of disability or marginalisation. We also welcome and encourage your own research project ideas.
