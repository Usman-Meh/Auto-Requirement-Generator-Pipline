Why study Mathematical Sciences at Flinders
The course features innovative assessment beyond quizzes and tests, which will develop your skills in communication, problem-solving, research and even how to use artificial intelligence (AI)
Study a collection of topics from a chosen second area within science, computing or engineering, such as computer science, biology, physics or chemistry to broaden your skills
Undertaking a unique industry placement where you’ll be embedded in a company or organisation solving a real problem while you study
Strong future employment growth predicted, with 1800 new graduates needed over the next five years (ANZSCO ID 2241, Labour Market Insights)
Ranked No.1 in SA in Science & Mathematics for learner engagement, learning resources, skills development and student support (The Good Universities Guide 2024 (undergraduate), public SA-founded universities only).
Your career
Demand for mathematics graduates is strong, as mathematics is essential to a range of industries including science, engineering, technology, medicine and business, and in areas as diverse as linguistics, political science and ecology. With a degree in mathematics, you can apply your skills to any field you are interested in.
Because of the wide range of uses, there are few jobs labelled simply “mathematician” and instead there’s a wide range of jobs that employ people with a degree in mathematics under different names. These call for people with skills in critical thinking, problem-solving, modelling and describing data.
The range of jobs available to maths graduates can be seen in the
MathsAdds guide
produced by the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute. This collects real job add that a graduate in mathematical sciences could apply for.
Potential occupations include:
App developer
Artificial intelligence developer
Cryptologist
Data scientist
Defence scientist
Financial analyst
Fraud analyst
Mathematician
Modeller
Marketing analyst
Researcher
Statistician.
Potential employers include:
Advanced manufacturers
Australian Bureau of Statistics
Banks and accountancy firms
Bureau of Meteorology
Defence Science and Technology Group
Research centres
Tech companies
Universities.
Professional accreditation/recognition
Graduates working in mathematics can apply for accreditation from the Australian Mathematical Society
Graduates working in statistics can apply for accreditation from the Statistical Society of Australia.
