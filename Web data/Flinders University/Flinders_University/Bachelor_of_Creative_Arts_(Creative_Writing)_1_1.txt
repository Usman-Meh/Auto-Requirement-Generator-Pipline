Hear from our students
“
Working with professionals and professional skill development have been incredible for me, especially since I was able to develop my own anthology and be able to come out of university as a published author. We worked closely with publishers, made lots of other contacts, did lots of editing and graphic design, so it has opened up a world of additional opportunities that I never thought possible.
Flinders is just a really welcoming space in generally, the creative spaces in the study rooms especially help us to do our work. We did a lock-in once overnight, so it is safe to say that we love the facilities on campus.”

“
Being given the opportunity to consistently build upon my own skills and put whatever I want out in the world has been great. I can explore so many varieties of fiction, science fiction, autobiographical writing, romance, fantasy just to name a couple, but I can use them as inspiration to write my own thesis and look into what inspires me.
I like that I am taught by people who are actually working in the industry and have continuously been publishing their own work. Dr Amy Matthews is a fantastic author and works with some of the best publishers. Dr Sean Williams has worked with some massive companies like LucasFilm and wrote Star Wars books.”

“
I really enjoy the fact that I am pretty much writing all the time and creatively do what I am passionate about. I love that I am given the opportunity to do just that, and really develop my skills exponentially further than I thought. I learnt lots of other things and developed a lot of professional leadership skills that I might never touch on later in life, but I still have those extra skills to help myself.
The atmosphere at Flinders is awesome because we’re so separate from the city and it feels like I can really get into my creative headspace compared to being in the city. Being around a community of real-world writers and publishers gives you hope and inspires you to get somewhere in life.”

“
I love how many different things this degree teaches you. I didn’t think that I would be learning Photoshop and other essential multimedia in a Creative Writing topic, so that’s been a very interesting challenge.
The atmosphere at Flinders is amazing, everything looks so up-to-date and advanced. I live more than an hour away and getting here from home is really easy with all the available transport options.”

“
I didn’t expect the amount of collaborative work we would be doing and also like that I am given the chance to branch out into many different areas. There is a smorgasbord of things I’m learning which is helping me develop a broad skillset. I believe Flinders offers one of the best Creative Writing degrees in the state, if not the country.”
