Animal biology
Choose a major in Animal Biology
Skin, scales, feathers, fur.
Scientists estimate there are 1-2 million species of animals on Earth—and we’ve only discovered a fraction of them. Animal biology is the study of living terrestrial, avian and aquatic animals. It explores the chemical and physical makeup of animals, including their evolution, behaviour, physiology, ecology and biodiversity. The diversity of animal life is astounding and the lessons we learn from animals can be applied to agriculture, environmental conservation and management, veterinary science, education and public policy. Learn in the field and the lab, with an eye to the global challenges facing animals and the role we play in their future.
