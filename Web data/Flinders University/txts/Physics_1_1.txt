Physics
Overview
The Master of Science (Physics) is designed for students with a physics-rich background who are looking for pathways to higher degree study or just looking to extend their knowledge with modern applications.
The course builds on a student’s existing physics, research and professional skills. It provides graduates with not only the practical and theoretical aspects of physics, but also an understanding of professional and ethical responsibilities and an awareness of social, economic, cultural and environmental aspects of physics in a global community. Projects and coursework have been designed to address topical concerns in industry and society preparing graduates for employment in a physics-related field or further enrolment in a higher degree by research.
A masters research thesis is normally taken in the final two semesters of study and develops research, communication and technical skills. An in-depth investigation of a particular area is completed under the guidance of a supervisor and students can opt to research advanced areas within the discipline.
