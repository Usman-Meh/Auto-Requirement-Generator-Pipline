Gender Mainstreaming Policy and Analysis
Overview
Develop specialised knowledge related to the integration of gender considerations into policy making, project design and implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Gender mainstreaming is an international strategy to achieve gender equality in all aspects of society and has been gradually adopted by many governments in developing and developed countries, including Australia.
Gender analysis is a foundational base for all economic and social development policy and development programs. The specialised skills the course offers in gender mainstreaming and gender analysis are applicable both in Australia and internationally.
Staff teaching the core topics in the Graduate Certificate in Gender Mainstreaming Policy and Analysis were awarded a citation in 2011 for outstanding contributions to student learning by the Australian Learning and Teaching Council.
