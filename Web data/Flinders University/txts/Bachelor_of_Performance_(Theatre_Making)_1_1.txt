Hear from our students
“
Flinders Drama Centre dramatically influenced the course of my life and career. When I started my studies at Drama Centre as an acting student, I was a 19-year-old teenager who had no idea that becoming a theatre director was an option for me.
My teachers identified this as a potential avenue for me, and gave me the courage and confidence to pursue directing as a career. Flinders Drama Centre set me up for employment in the industry by teaching me the craft of theatre direction, providing industry placement opportunities, giving me a voice as an emerging artist and teaching me to be bold in my artistic choices.
Nescha Jelk, Flinders alumni.
