Engineering Management
Overview
Engineering Management combines the problem-solving and technical design ability of engineering and other scientific and technology focused disciplines with executive organisational skills and the planning power of business and management. Central to this are advanced project management skills (both for large-scale complex projects and for smaller-scale projects). Together they enable graduates to manage complex engineering driven enterprises across a range of discipline areas.
Engineering managers are required across of range of industry sectors from traditional engineering operations (such as construction, manufacturing and energy), though to managing complex defence acquisition and large-scale software engineering projects. They oversee teams of engineers and work closely with other professionals to oversee the successful delivery of complex engineering projects.
