Information Technology
Overview
If you are a graduate with a previous degree in an area other than information technology but are looking to upgrade and extend your knowledge and skills in this dramatically changing area, the information technology program at Flinders provides the perfect introduction.
These courses capitalise on the demand for professionals as information technology is applied across a continually widening range of applications, from intelligent consumer goods such as mobile phones and cars through to electronic medical records. They address the profession’s growing concern about a looming skills shortage in the area of information technology.
The focus on Flinders University’s strengths in the design, implementation and management of enterprise information technology and the application of information technology to information retrieval, analysis and visualisation characterise this program. The courses integrate with the strong and active research and development program in the College of Science and Engineering, carried out as externally funded research and development.
