Why undertake a PhD in Disability and Community Inclusion at Flinders
Our emphasis is on community-led and community-focused work that builds on capacity and strength. We still recognise the very real levels of disadvantage faced by individual people and communities, and the way that systems and structures shape this experience.
Co-design and coproduction are fundamental to our approach, ensuring people with disability drive research design, implementation and sharing of outcomes.
Contribute to a culture where people with disability are involved in all parts of the leadership, learning, teaching and research community.
Benefit from our partnerships with government, service providers, industry and community both nationally and internationally to collaborate and deliver evidence-based transformative change to industry, individuals and community.
Join our highly collaborative research culture, working alongside and with highly awarded researchers and supervisors who are nationally and internationally recognised in their fields.
Be involved in the research from the Caring Futures Institute which develops the evidence to inform the services that people with disability deserve greater wellbeing, participation, belonging and safer relationships.
