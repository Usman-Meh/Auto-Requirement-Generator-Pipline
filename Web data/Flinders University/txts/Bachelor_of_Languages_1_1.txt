"As part of this degree, I have had opportunities both in-country and overseas to enrich my learning experience.
In my 2nd year, I completed a 6-month internship with the Spanish Embassy of Education, where I helped devise a database to better understand how Spanish is taught in schools. Then in my 3rd year, I travelled to Argentina on a semester exchange at Universidad de Belgrano in Buenos Aires. There, I took classes in Spanish on Argentinian Literature, Human Rights, Tango, Language, and even Portuguese with local students. Finally, I was also able to participate in an NCP-funded program to New Caledonia, where I studied the French language for two weeks through the lens of the Kanak culture."
Alexandra Reinhardt, Bachelor of Languages (French and Spanish)
"I found that the teaching staff are willing to go above and beyond to help students maximize their potential.
As most of our classes were small, our lecturers could easily identify any struggles that we were having and focus on these for our understanding. Plus, with the founding of the Flinders Languages Club, it’s now easier than ever to find a group of friendly people who are always happy to practice speaking with you."
Cody Tonkin, Bachelor of Languages (Spanish and Applied Linguistics)
