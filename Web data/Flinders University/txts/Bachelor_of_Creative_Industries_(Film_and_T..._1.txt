“
I got the opportunity to direct a TV pilot which has always been a dream of mine.
Meeting friends that will move into the same industry as me is the most valuable thing I gained from this degree. I’ve also got to learn about the parts of filmmaking that I am most passionate about. Helen Carter is an incredible example of a woman in the industry and Claire Henry knows her topics so deeply that it's infectious.
