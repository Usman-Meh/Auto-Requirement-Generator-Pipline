What you will study
The Master of Teaching (Primary) consists of 72units over either 1.5 or two years. The 1.5 year accelerated degree is undertaken as 45-units in the first year and 27-units in the final semester as a full-time load or the equivalent on a part-time basis, while the 2-year equivalent consists of 36 units per year.
The program of study commences with an introduction to teaching and educational research, investigation of learners and the factors which impact on their development and well-being, and anexploration of teaching in and through the Expressive Arts. Evidence-based models are introduced to understand the structure and nature of literacy and language development in the early years, and there are opportunities to develop the repertoire of practice required to teach literacy and English in primary settings. The first professional experience has a strong focus on building professional relationships, proactive and responsive classroom management, and developing the ability to reflect on and respond to professional feedback.
Primary curriculum topics in Humanities and Social Sciences (HASS), Mathematics, Science, Design Technologies, Health and Physical Education, numeracy and digital technologies develop pre-service teachers’ capacity to plan for effective and innovative learning and assessment supported by well-developed pedagogical reasoning and disciplinary knowledge and skills. Professional studies topics examine differentiation and inclusive educational practices, and critical indigenous pedagogical approaches. In the final semester, pre-service teachers demonstrate their capacity to assume the roles and responsibilities of a graduate teacher, make explicit their personal professional philosophy of education and prepare to transition into the teaching profession.
Practical experience
You will be engaged throughout the entire program in developing the skills to become a teacher. The course includes blocks of professional experience in first and second year as required by the Teachers Registration Board of South Australia.
Practical experience requirements
All College of Education, Psychology and Social Work pre-service teachers must obtain a Working With Children Check (WWCC) from the Department for Human Service (DHS) Screening Unit and a Responding to Risks of Harm, Abuse and Neglect: Education and Care (RRHAN-EC) from a registered provider before undertaking their professional experience. This is a requirement of the Department for Education (DfE), in agreement with the Catholic Education and Independent Schools Boards. Pre-service teachers who are not cleared will therefore not be able to complete the requirements of the course.
Instructions about applications are
provided on the professional experience website

Inherent requirements
The Australian Government has introduced the Literacy and Numeracy Test for all initial teacher education (ITE) students to ensure they have the high level of personal literacy and numeracy skills required of teachers.
The test is a national instrument designed to assess elements of an individual's literacy and numeracy skills and will be used to demonstrate that ITE graduates are in the top 30 per cent of the population for literacy and numeracy.
All students graduating from any ITE course in South Australia must have achieved the standard for both the literacy and numeracy components of the Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education (LANTITE) to graduate.
