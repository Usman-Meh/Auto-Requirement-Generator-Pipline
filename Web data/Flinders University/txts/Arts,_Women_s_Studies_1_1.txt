Gender and Development, Women's Studies
Overview
Australia’s only master’s course in women’s studies, Flinders’ Master of Arts (Women’s and Gender Studies) will help you develop the skills and knowledge to think critically on issues of gender and its intersections with sexuality, class, and racial differences. To gain perspective. To create change.
To help tell the stories and ensure they are heard.
Offered both in-person and online, Flinders Women’s and Gender studies explores the importance of the concepts and constructs surrounding gender and society. Why so many think the way they do. How societies developed upon gender-orientated lines, and why it’s more important than ever to question taken-for-granted assumptions to build a more balanced, inclusive and just future.
It explores feminist politics and different types of feminism, women’s empowerment, human rights, indigenous knowledges, LGBTIQ issues - intersectional approaches help us understand who we are, and how we can better advocate for those whose experience is different to ours.

She acknowledges the sovereignty of the Kaurna people on whose land she lives, works and dreams of a positive future for the planet.

"
From the theoretical and the practical topics that were taught in the course I have learnt how to apply intersectional feminist frameworks to examine the intertwining issues related to equality and women’s rights that affect community and country. By studying experiences and theories from different continents and countries across the globe, we not only have access to the best practices but also the valuable lessons that many feminist movements and initiatives have learned; thus with this knowledge and skills, I feel very confident to go back to my country and contribute to building a concrete platform for my community’s development
