Bachelor of Engineering (Environmental) (Honours)
Study Environmental Engineering at Flinders
Engineer the environment for a sustainable world.
Environmental engineering is where advances in science and technology are transformed into practical solutions that will protect and improve the quality of our environment. Environmental engineers are problem-solvers who design solutions to a range of hazards from airborne and waterborne diseases, water and air pollution, wastewater management and recycling. They implement environmental engineering law and assess the environmental impact of proposed projects.
