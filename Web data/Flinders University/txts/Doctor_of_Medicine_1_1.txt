Doctor of Medicine
Overview
To become a Medical Doctor (MD) you need to study a Doctor of Medicine. Flinders University offers graduate entry to the Doctor of Medicine (MD) in South Australia and the Northern Territory. The four-year course enables you to graduate with a medical qualification comparable to a six-year medicine degree.
The Doctor of Medicine (MD) aims to develop the elements of knowledge, understanding and skill central to varied areas of medical practice, producing graduates well prepared for their internship and with the potential to follow a full range of medical specialties in subsequent training.
Flinders University has a considerable presence in rural and remote communities throughout South Australia and the Northern Territory.
To address the health work force gap in rural and remote areas, the university offers students the opportunity to study the Flinders Doctor of Medicine (MD) in Darwin, Northern Territory and in rural South Australia.
Flinders further provides rich and innovative student clinical placements across our clinical schools in Darwin, Nhulunbuy, Katherine Tennant Creek, Alice Springs, Bedford Park, the Riverland, Mount Gambier and the Greater Green Triangle, the Adelaide Hills, Mallee, Fleurieu and Barossa Valley.
Flinders has a strong profile in medicine both nationally and internationally and continues to be at the forefront of innovation in teaching and research.

Extend your Doctor of Medicine (MD) and pursue multiple passions with a combined degree
Combining your Doctor of Medicine (MD) with the Master of Public Health.

Doctor of Medicine / Master of Public Health
Kickstart your career as a clinician scientist by integrating a PhD in your Doctor of Medicine (MD).
You can reap the rewards of medical research with this well-supported and structured pathway to become a clinical scientist and future leader.
Study a MD-PhD
Your career
Upon graduation, you must complete a year as a hospital intern to qualify for medical registration with the Medical Board of Australia. After internship and a possible further year in a training position, you can then apply to undertake specialist training with a medical college. In addition to clinical practice in a wide range of medical specialties, medical graduates may work in research, public health or community aid around the world, or in health administration.
Potential occupations after internship include:
general practitioner
hospital medical officer
medical specialist
general practitioner in urban, rural and remote settings.
Professional accreditation/recognition
The Flinders University medical program has been re-accredited by the  Australian Medical Council until 31 March 2025. Graduates of the Medicine degree will be registered with the Medical Board of Australia and permitted to practise medicine in Australia.
What you will study
Throughout the course there are three broad topics or themes: doctor and patient, knowledge of health and illness, and health professions and society. The program focuses on student-centred learning with longitudinal development of the knowledge, skills and personal and professional attributes required of a doctor. Topics cover areas such as interaction between doctor and patient, knowledge of health and illness, health professions and society, socially responsible health practice, clinical research foundations, and advanced studies.
Practical experience
The degree offers a hand-on approach, blending community and hospital training that offers you exposure to the broad spectrum of health care from the primary to the tertiary level. Topics introduce you to clinical practice and performance, and you will undertake practicals and clinical placements throughout the degree.
Practical experience requirements
This course includes clinical placements which aim to provide students with the practical experience required for the workplace. Students who are required to complete clinical placements must be immunised in accordance with the relevant State or Territory immunisation standards (eg Health Immunisation for Health Care Workers in South Australia 2014 Policy Guideline) and any additional private provider requirements as needed.

South Australian sub-quotas and Place Types
Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Sub-quota
We support the Commonwealth and Northern Territory Governments’ key priority to increase the participation of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people in medicine.
We are committed to equity and inclusiveness in the Doctor of Medicine. Flinders recognises and values the contribution that Indigenous knowledge and Indigenous doctors make to the health of our country. Our Indigenous and non-Indigenous staff teach you how to work safely and confidently in a multicultural society.
As an Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander applicant you can choose from two pathways into the Doctor of Medicine.
If you have an undergraduate degree but do
not
have a valid GAMSAT score, you can apply for entry into the
Indigenous Entry Stream (IES)
. Alternatively, if you
do
have a valid GAMSAT score you can apply for direct entry through the Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Sub-quota.
Both pathways have different timelines and requirements.
Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander applicants may confirm their Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander identity in one of two ways:
Confirmation of Indigeneity
- provide a formal document, confirming their Indigeneity, from an incorporated Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander organisation, containing the Common Seal of the organisation.
Or
Affirmation of Indigeneity
- when a document under Common Seal is not able to be obtained, applicants may submit an
Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander descent Statutory Declaration
.
Permanent Humanitarian Visa Holder Sub-quota
Up to 4 places are available for applicants who currently hold or have held a Humanitarian Visa issued by the Australian Government and are permanent residents or citizens of Australia.
