Think about what you study. Study what you think.
Are you fascinated by how people think? Psychology is the study of human behaviour and experience. It considers how we learn and develop during our lives, our relationships with other people, individual differences such as personality and self-esteem, thinking processes, the role of biological factors in how we behave, and the causes and treatment of psychological problems. Draw on the real-world experience of our staff, who consult for judges and lawyers, medical practitioners, psychologists and government at state and national levels. Psychology is always diverse and interesting, and can lead to many different career paths.
