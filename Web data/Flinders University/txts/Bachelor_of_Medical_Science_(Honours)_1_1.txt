Bachelor of Medical Science (Honours)
Study Medical Science at Flinders
Investigate the science of the human body.
The Bachelor of Medical Science (Honours) – 4 years is designed to offer students an opportunity to extend their undergraduate studies by demonstrating their ability to work in a research environment. The course extends the curriculum offered in the Bachelor of Medical Science (BMS) and includes higher performance expectations.
The BMS degree has been designed to produce graduates who as medical scientists are specialists in a major area of science and possess well-developed skills to liaise with other groups of scientists, such as medical practitioners and biotechnologists. Extending on this, the Honours year provides students with the opportunity to undertake an individual research project in an area of medical science, from design to execution. Students will gain experience in research design, and develop their abilities in critical analysis of information, data management and theory generation using both qualitative and quantitative methods.
