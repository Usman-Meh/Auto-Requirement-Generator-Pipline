"
The experience I had at Flinders definitely set me up for success in my current career as an early childhood teacher. Just as children can learn so much from Mother Nature, so do we as adults. Flinders’ beautiful natural environments provided me with lots of inspiration, motivation and space to think, learn and reflect. I was provided with endless resources and opportunities to learn and experience, and during placements was very well supported, with course coordinators that listened and helped me every step of the way.
