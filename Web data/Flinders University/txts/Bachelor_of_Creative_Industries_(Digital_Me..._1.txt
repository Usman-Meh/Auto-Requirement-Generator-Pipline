“
I decided to study Digital Media as I wanted to explore a variety of media that will advance my knowledge in the industry. Flinders offers varying subjects from digital graphic design to motion capture and VFX. I have always been a creative person while loving technology and using programs. I didn't want to be on the film set or photoshoot, I wanted to be the postproduction person creating all the after-magic.
