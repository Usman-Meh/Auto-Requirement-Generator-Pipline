What you will study
The program teaches you to research, analyse and articulate a framework for inclusive and ethical professional social work practice. You will develop the skills to identify the cultural context of various approaches and their relevance to specific situations and populations, and to delineate the connections between interpersonal practice, social policy and research. Topics cover areas such as social work with diverse populations, complexities in work with children and families, mental health through the life course, and trauma and resilience.
Practical experience
You will undertake two field placements totalling 500 hours each. Placements are usually offered over four days per week.
Placements are designed to provide you with learning opportunities in a range of practice settings, with varied practice methodologies and different client groups.
Field placements enable you to develop professional values, knowledge and skills and demonstrate your judgement and expertise.
Practical experience requirements
You are required to receive a National Criminal History Check and Department for Communities and Social Inclusion (DCSI) screening and background checks, stating that you have successful clearances, in order to be eligible to undertake field placements. Students who do not receive DCSI clearances will not be able to complete their placement and therefore complete their degree. You are strongly advised to hold an Australian Driver’s Licence. Some placement agencies require students to receive vaccinations.
