Politics
Choose a major in Politics
Lead with a difference.
Studying politics is more than just voting in elections or debates in parliament — it is the study of people, power and society. It determines how we live and work, solve challenges and shape the future, and touches on every part of our lives: from education to jobs, from housing to immigration, from health to global relationships. Politics keeps the peace and thrusts us into war.
With a major in Politics, you can tailor your topics to your interests - whether you’re fascinated by the rise of China, or aspire to pursue social causes in Australian parliament. Since our political landscapes are constantly shifting, there is always more to know.
