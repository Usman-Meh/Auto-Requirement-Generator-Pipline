Gain a deep understanding of French language and culture.
Study a French major and explore French language and culture. You will gain language and intercultural skills to communicate effectively across diverse social and professional contexts, and gain a deep appreciation of the Francophone world: its historical, cultural and social landscape; as well as its traditions, values, identities, and perspectives.
The team will make sure you are learning - but also having fun. You'll develop knowledge about vocabulary, grammar, and phonetics, but also dive into cultural aspects including literature, cinema, theatre and gastronomy. On completion of the French major, you could pursue roles in language teaching, translation, interpretation, business,  international relations, policy development, research and more.
