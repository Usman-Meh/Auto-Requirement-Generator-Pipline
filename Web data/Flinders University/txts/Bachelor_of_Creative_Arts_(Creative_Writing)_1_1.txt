Hear from our students
“
Working with professionals and professional skill development have been incredible for me, especially since I was able to develop my own anthology and be able to come out of university as a published author. We worked closely with publishers, made lots of other contacts, did lots of editing and graphic design, so it has opened up a world of additional opportunities that I never thought possible.
Flinders is just a really welcoming space in generally, the creative spaces in the study rooms especially help us to do our work. We did a lock-in once overnight, so it is safe to say that we love the facilities on campus.”

Bachelor of Creative Arts (Creative Writing) (Honours)
“
Being given the opportunity to consistently build upon my own skills and put whatever I want out in the world has been great. I can explore so many varieties of fiction, science fiction, autobiographical writing, romance, fantasy just to name a couple, but I can use them as inspiration to write my own thesis and look into what inspires me.
I like that I am taught by people who are actually working in the industry and have continuously been publishing their own work. Dr Amy Matthews is a fantastic author and works with some of the best publishers. Dr Sean Williams has worked with some massive companies like LucasFilm and wrote Star Wars books.”

Bachelor of Creative Arts (Creative Writing) (Honours)
“
I really enjoy the fact that I am pretty much writing all the time and creatively do what I am passionate about. I love that I am given the opportunity to do just that, and really develop my skills exponentially further than I thought. I learnt lots of other things and developed a lot of professional leadership skills that I might never touch on later in life, but I still have those extra skills to help myself.
The atmosphere at Flinders is awesome because we’re so separate from the city and it feels like I can really get into my creative headspace compared to being in the city. Being around a community of real-world writers and publishers gives you hope and inspires you to get somewhere in life.”

“
I love how many different things this degree teaches you. I didn’t think that I would be learning Photoshop and other essential multimedia in a Creative Writing topic, so that’s been a very interesting challenge.
The atmosphere at Flinders is amazing, everything looks so up-to-date and advanced. I live more than an hour away and getting here from home is really easy with all the available transport options.”

“
I didn’t expect the amount of collaborative work we would be doing and also like that I am given the chance to branch out into many different areas. There is a smorgasbord of things I’m learning which is helping me develop a broad skillset. I believe Flinders offers one of the best Creative Writing degrees in the state, if not the country.”
