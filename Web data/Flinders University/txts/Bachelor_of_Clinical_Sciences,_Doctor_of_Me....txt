Additional entry requirements
Applicants must also complete the University Clinical Aptitude Test for Australia and New Zealand (UCAT ANZ). Final ranking for a place is determined by combining scores from the applicant's Year 12 subject results that are used to calculate the ATAR (or equivalent) and their UCAT results.
It is expected that applicants will need to achieve an ATAR of 95 or above (after the addition of any relevant adjustment factors) to be competitive for a place. Ranking for offers of places will be based on a rank combining Year 12 subject results (90%) and a UCAT ANZ-derived score (10%), which will be based on results from five sections of the UCAT ANZ test (Verbal Reasoning, Decision Making, Quantitative Reasoning, Abstract Reasoning and Situational Judgment), with each section equally contributing to the UCAT ANZ-derived score.
Adjustment factors
Adjustment factors are available through the University Equity Scheme only.
Admission pathways
This course is only available to school leavers - i.e. applicants who are competing for entry on the basis of performance in either SACE Stage 2 studies, the International Baccalaureate or the interstate/overseas equivalent and do not have an academic record of study at higher education level (including Bachelor degrees from TAFE or RTOs).
