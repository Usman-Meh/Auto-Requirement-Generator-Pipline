The fact that the profession of blockchain technology engineer opens up excellent career opportunities is partly due to the growing importance of information technology and the corresponding increase in demand for young talent. Companies and organisations are increasingly looking for specialists in this field to optimise their processes - in recent years, the number of graduates has always been lower than the annual demand for blockchain technology engineers.
Your career opportunities include: Blockchain expert:in in logistics, energy, healthcare or the financial industry.
