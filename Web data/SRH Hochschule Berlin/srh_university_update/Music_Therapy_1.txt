More clinical institutions and therapeutic centres are focusing on creative therapeutic/artistic methods with a scientific basis.
Our music therapy Master's programme lasts two years and integrates an intensive work placement phase. The programme includes practical music lessons, therapeutic techniques, and scientific content. We specialise in music therapy in psychiatry, psychosomatics, psychotherapy, and neurology. You will also learn how to use music to treat people in a wide variety of circumstances.
Our philosophy is to combine teaching, practice and research under one roof. We teach you music therapy, music and psychological/medical course content in an application-orientated way. You can practise and further develop the knowledge and skills acquired in the campus outpatient music therapy clinic and the internships. You can actively participate in the faculty's ongoing research projects and pursue your application-related research questions in the in-house psychophysiological laboratory.
