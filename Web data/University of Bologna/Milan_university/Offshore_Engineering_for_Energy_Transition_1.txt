Experiences abroad
The programme develops the ability, inherent to energy-related industries, to operate in the global environment thanks to international ERASMUS+ mobility scheme for study purposes, internships and thesis completion and to dedicated scholarships.
As a graduate of Civil Engineering with main knowledge of structures, my first year has been a mix of reference to basic and advanced exposure to Offshore Engineering. Despite the interesting challenges posed, the prospects of the possibilities and the encounter with many international students and the serene city of Ravenna make it all worthwhile!
