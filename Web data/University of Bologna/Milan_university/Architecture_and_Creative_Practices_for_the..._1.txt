Experiences abroad
The programme is a stimulating environment of international comparison, which is complemented by the possibility of participating in exchange programmes, both in the EU and outside the EU, as well at internships and theses abroad. These experiences provide an advantage for entering the international labour market.
The knowledge and experiences I learned in this program, thanks to the laboratory lessons, helped me a lot during my master thesis internship. I am very happy that I had the chance to think, discuss and produce on architecture, urbanism, sustainability issues during the ACPCL course with its multidisciplinary and innovative approach.
