Professional profiles
ElectricalEnergy Engineer
Function in aprofessional context:
Highly qualified, specialist expert and/or manager of the study, design,development, production, industrialisation and management of complex and/orinnovative systems with a high electrical technological content.
- Works on the development and advanced design of electrical components,equipment and machines and electronic power systems for highly complexcommercial articles and products in the electronic power, electrical, electromechanics, mechanic industries, industrial automation and robotics and manufacturingindustries generally.
- Monitors the reliability and quality of industrial processes andproducts.
- Contributes to the management and coordination of industrial Researchand Development departments. Manages laboratory work, following experimentationon electrical and electronic power components and equipment, using even highlycomplex measuring instruments and systems, numerical simulation methods,defining protocols and testing procedures and coordinating the testingoperations.
- Manages the design, operation and maintenance of electrical powerstations and distributed generation plants based on renewable sources and theirinterface with the national power grid.
- Manages the design, planning and management of electrical energytransmission and distribution systems.
- Manages the design, planning and management of electrical transportsystems and networks.
- Participates in research work on innovative and experimental systemswith a high electrical technological content in the field of research bodies.
- Solves problems and carries out conventional and non-conventionaltests for electrical equipment diagnostics, electromagnetic compatibility andelectrical safety.
- Oversees the quality of electrical energy, energy savings, energymanagement and energy trading in the free electricity market
Competenciesassociated to the function:
The main knowledge/skills of electrical energy engineers include:
- in-depth knowledge of the practical aspects of mathematics, physicsand other basic sciences for the interpretation and resolution of problemsaffecting applied electromagnetism and electromagnetic compatibility;
- in-depth knowledge of fossil-fuel and alternative electricityproduction systems e.g. photovoltaic plants, wind farms and fuel cells, interms of their operation, management and design;
- in-depth knowledge of converters, machinery, electric drives,electrical propulsion systems and their steady-state and transient operationand the related control techniques;
- in-depth knowledge of the operation of electrical power systems inpermanent, dynamic and transient including power plants, electricaltransmission and distribution networks and the related operating techniques;
- in-depth knowledge of numerical techniques for computer simulations ofthe operation of converters, machinery, electric drives and electric powersystems;
- in-depth knowledge of the design methodologies  of electrical machinery, as well as themeasuring and testing technique of these and electrical installations;
- in-depth knowledge of the theory of measurement, evaluation ofmeasuring errors and uncertainties and modern measuring techniques onelectrical machinery and installations;
- in-depth knowledge of electronic measuring instruments and sensors;
- in-depth knowledge of high voltage techniques and plasma engineering;
- knowledge of business economics and the management of technologicalassets;
- the ability to identify, formulate and solve complex problemsrequiring an inter-disciplinary approach in an innovative manner;
- self-learning and lifelong learning skills.
Careeropportunities:
The main career opportunities for electrical energy engineeringgraduates lie in the design and management of complex systems with a hightechnological content, both as freelancers, working alone or in associatedforms, and as employees in manufacturing and service industries and in thecivil service. In particular, 2nd cycle graduates may find employment in:
- electrical and electronic equipment and machinery productionindustries;
- electronic power systems production industries;
- companies and authorities involved in the production, transmission anddistribution of energy;
- companies and bodies working in the design, planning, operation andmonitoring of electrical energy systems;
- companies and bodies working in the design, planning, operation and monitoringof electrical transport systems and networks;
- automation and robotics industries;
- measuring instrument and electrical sensors manufacturers;
- companies and authorities involved in the production and management ofautomated goods and services;
- industrial laboratories;
- public and private research bodies;
- regulatory and control bodies;
- freelance work as an individual or in associated form.
Electrical Energy Engineers may also find employment in the civilengineering and building sector.
In Emilia Romagna, one of the highest concentrations of small and mediumenterprises in the country, the skills developed during the 2nd cycle degreeprogramme in Electrical Energy Engineering are requested and appreciated notonly by public and private industries and services in the specific sector, butalso by a wider technological area covering mechanical and electromechanicalbusinesses, automatic machinery and manufacturing industries, which are highlyrepresented in the area, as well as by engineering firms and associatedtechnical firms.
Access to further study
It gives access to third cycle studies (Dottorato di ricerca/Scuole di specializzazione) and master courses of second degree.
