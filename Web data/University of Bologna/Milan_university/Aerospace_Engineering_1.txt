Why choose this programme
You will be able to take part in a space mission.
By studying in Sweden for a year, you will obtain a double degree.
You will find out that the mythological CICLoPE (Italian for Cyclops) is also a unique experimental aerodynamic lab.
You will have a whole semester for your own personal project.
Lectures, lab activities and experience out in the airfield.
Professional profiles
Aerospace and astronautical Engineer Function in a professional context:The aerospace and astronautical Engineer:- drafts simplified physical and mathematical models to estimate aerodynamic loads, to analyse motion in various aerospace and industrial applications, calculating the aerodynamic load on various elements;- carries out experimental tests in flow-controlled areas (wind tunnels, long pipe) and he/she critically interprets data;- designs and manages quality and production systems in manufacturing industries which apply advanced technologies in the field of aerospace materials, aerodynamics and light structures;- analyses and selects the treatments and functionalisation of materials (both structural and functional materials) and production process for specific components in the aeronautical and space sector, taking into account the effect that the transformation and subsequent processing may have on the structure and properties of the material;- guarantees the design, production, testing and management of the principal conventional and non-conventional aerospace systems and sub-systems, managing the production and the optimisation of processes;- designs and plans new technical solutions for the aeronautical and space industry, starting from the definition of specifications through to prototyping and production, and monitors the reliability and quality of production;- draws up physical and mathematical models to interpret the behaviour of the aerospace systems and sub-systems and the dynamic interactions with the external environment, by using specific survey methods, including simulation for experimental, analytical and numerical modelling;- designs systems and sub-systems and plants on board in aeronautical and space vehicles, to ensure the operational life of the system (vehicle guidance and control, power output and distribution, avionics and on-board information transmission and processing electronic systems, thermal control and air-conditioning systems, etc.) as well as designs ground systems for mission control and experimentation;- deals with the ground and flight experimentation of aeronautical and space systems, aircraft guidance navigation and control;- designs and develops methodologies, systems, subsystems and instrumentation for special applications including remote sensing and the aircraft payload for all applications conducted by means remotely piloted aircraft;- draws up physical and mathematical models to interpret the behaviour and to optimise trajectories and to study the influence of aircraft centring on stability and controllability features and of configuration on take-off and landing performance ;- critically analyses airline fleets and solve problems affecting the management and control of airline fleets, aircraft maintenance, also with regard to the modification and certification of systems and installations and the management of operational, administrative and technical-commercial processes;- oversees the process for the certification of remotely piloted aircraft and the authorisation process to conduct operations and provides consulting for accidents;- takes part in aerospace scientific research projects, both in the academic and the industrial sector;- assumes organisational and managerial roles requiring sound technological skills, particularly with regard to the analysis and management of the design and production processes;Competencies associated with the function:The Aerospace and astronautical Engineer:- has an in-depth knowledge of the flight vehicles and spacecraft systems and components;- is familiar with the innovative techniques for modelling, design and prototyping aerospace systems;- is familiar with the main methodologies and the operational issues related to industrial engineering;- is familiar with information engineering basic aspects;- is familiar with the regulation for aircraft and remotely piloted aircraft operations, and international air traffic control regulations; - has an in-depth knowledge of experimental and numerical methods to validate data;- is familiar with the process for the certification of aircraft components and remotely piloted aircraft;- can interact with colleagues and professionals working in the aerospace industry and research sector.Career opportunities:Thanks to the competences acquired, graduates in master degree in Aerospace Engineering have a large variety of career opportunities, and they can assume roles of responsibility in the industrial sector and management roles in research projects.Graduates in master degree in Aerospace Engineering can work in the following areas: Research, development and manufacturing in the aerospace, naval, mechanical, processing and car manufacturing industries. Italian and international research centres in the aerospace industry. Companies developing remote piloted systems and that operate remotely piloted aircraft.Industries producing machinery and systems for which fluid-dynamics, advanced materials and light structures, electrical and hydraulic systems and their interaction, and wind energy production systems are significant aspects.Aircraft maintenance companies and flight schools for the obtainment of commercial licenses. Air traffic control authorities.National and European space agencies.Public sector technical offices.Freelance professional activity is subject to passing the State exam and registration with the Order of Engineers.
Access to further study
It gives access to third cycle studies (Dottorato di ricerca/Scuole di specializzazione) and master universitario di secondo livello.
What you will study
Curriculum Aeronautics: for students enrolled a.y. 2024-25
Curriculum Space: for students enrolled a.y. 2024-25
Experiences abroad
As part of the experiences abroad, the course offers the possibility of internships in international organisations and participation in exchange programmes.
