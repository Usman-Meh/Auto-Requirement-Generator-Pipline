Professional profiles
Geologist Function in a professional context:The Geologist uses a broad spectrum of skills and competencies in the fields of chemistry, physics, biology and mathematics to study the materials of the Earth's lithosphere and their composition, and to explain the geological processes that form and modify them, as well as geomorphological evolution. The Geologist also applies these skills and competences to civil engineering problems, to the assessment of geological and environmental risks, to land and environmental planning, to the assessment of human impact on ecosystems, to the remediation of contaminated and/or degraded sites, and to the identification and management of energy, mining, groundwater and geo-tourism resources. The Geologist is a key professional figure in all studies, research and applications concerning land and environmental management, in terms of the mitigation of geological-environmental risks and the sustainable exploitation of geo-resources, both renewable and non-renewable.The professional activities of the Geologist include:a) geological surveying and remote sensing, with special reference to geological and environmental issues;b) the analysis of geological and environmental hazards for the purposes of risk prevention and mitigation, with the drafting of specific cartographic tools, as well as the planning and design of interventions aimed at risk reduction;c) hydrogeological and geochemical analyses for the detection, management and protection of groundwater, also to mitigate the effects of climate change, and for the characterisation and remediation of contaminated sites;d) geognostic surveys and subsurface exploration, including by geophysical methods;e) geotechnical investigations and reports;f) the detection, evaluation and management of geo-resources and geo-materials of industrial and commercial interest for the definition of a circular economy;g) the analysis, management and rehabilitation of disused or degraded mining sites;h) geological tools for spatial and urban planning, based on the modelling of geo-environmental systems and related processes;i) stratigraphic, geodetic, topographic, oceanographic and atmospheric surveys, including meteo-climatic parameters, characterising the dynamics of river and coastal systems;j) analyses, physico-mechanical characterisation and certification of geological materials.Geologists can serve as mining director (open pit, underground, at sea) and as supervising engineering geologist. They may also coordinate technical and managerial structures and hold the role of Director and Guarantor of geotechnical laboratories. In performing their activities, geologists work with many other professional figures, particularly environmental engineers, civil engineers, structural engineers, architects, chemists, physicists, biologists, archaeologists and restorers.Competencies associated with the function:In order to carry out the roles described above, specific knowledge, abilities and skills in the geological and technical-scientific field are required:- in-depth knowledge of the genesis, the formation environments, and the compositional and physical-mechanical characteristics of rocks and sediments;- ability to read the territory and to interpret the dynamics of geological processes, not only spatially but also temporally, by integrating different types of data;- ability to assess and manage the uncertainty of data and measurements, and to process data statistically, as well as to critically assess the significance of models reconstructed from partial data;- self-learning and continuous professional updating abilities;- computer skills and the use of various types of technology platforms, for both on-the-field and laboratory activities;- adequate transferable competences such as communication, interpersonal, organisational, management and planning skills, according to the level of autonomy and responsibility assigned, the organisation, the working methods adopted, and the main interlocutors (colleagues, other professionals and public and/or private clients);- entrepreneurial skills such as innovation, creativity and a sense of initiative.Employment opportunities:- Professional firms, engineering and construction companies- Agencies and bodies for environmental protection, spatial planning, protection against geological risks (e.g. Civil Defence, Geological Services, ARPAE, River Authorities);- Bodies managing aqueducts and the integrated water cycle;- Companies and organisations working in the field of marine geology and site surveying for offshore plants and facilities;- Energy and mining industry for the sustainable retrieval and exploitation of geo-resources within the context of a circular economy;- Scientific research in academia;- Geological museums, geosites and geoparks, and scientific outreach programmes;- Freelance work.The work of the Geologist is currently regulated by state law and its practice is conditional upon passing the relevant state examination and enrolling in section A of the Professional Register of Geologists, but this is not necessarily the only possible job market outlet for graduates.Furthermore, graduates with the credits required by the laws in force may also sit the entrance exams for high school teacher training programmes.
Access to further study
It gives access to third cycle studies (Dottorato di ricerca/Scuole di specializzazione) and master universitario di secondo livello.
What you will study
Curriculum Raw Materials Exploration and Sustainability: for students enrolled a.y. 2024-25
Curriculum Processi Geologici, Rischi e Risorse (PROGRESS): per studenti immatricolati nell'a.a. 2024-25
Experiences abroad
In terms of experience abroad, the programme offers the opportunity to serve an internship with an international organisation or participate in an exchange programme. These experiences offer opportunities for direct contact with international organisations, enriching the student’s understanding of global dynamics and providing a real advantage in the international labour market.
My study experience was a personal turning point that taught me to observe reality analytically, allowing me to improve my knowledge. I found being able to put my knowledge into practice in the Course's different practical activities very useful.
