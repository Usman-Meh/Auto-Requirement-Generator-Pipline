Professional Profile
Pursuant to Decree no. 270 of 22 October 2004 of the Ministry of Education, University and Research, for academic year 2024/2025, Alma Mater Studiorum – Università di Bologna, Administrative office of Bologna, will run a 2° level Professional Master’s Programme in “Sustainable and integrated mobility in urban regions - Mobilità integrata e sostenibile nelle aree urbane”.
The Professional Master’s Programme has been set up on the proposal of the Department of Civil, Chemical, Environmental, and Materials Engineering.
The Professional Master’s Programme aims to train specialized professionals in the design and management of urban and regional mobility. Currently, issues related to sustainable mobility, new mo-bility services (Bike-share, Car-share, Car-pool, Ride-hail, On-de-mand bus services), their integration with public and private transport systems, and the use of "big data" for the design, moni-toring, and assessment of transport demand and supply are signif-icantly expanding in Italy, Europe, and worldwide.
The Master’s program aligns with the measures aimed at achieving United Nations SDG 11: “Sustainable Cities and Communities.” It aims to provide knowledge related to the sustainable and inte-grated design of urban mobility, with the following objectives:
• Develop a Sustainable Urban Mobility Plan;
• Assess, design, and improve urban accessibility;
• Serve as a "Mobility Manager" in companies, organizations, and consortia;
•Design transport infrastructures using green and eco-com-patible materials to promote recycling in line with Minimum Environmental Criteria (CAM);
•Design and monitor intermodal hubs;
•Analyse and improve road safety in urban areas;
•Design innovative "cycling paths and greenways";
•Conduct analyses of sustainable mobility services;
•Introduce innovative systems into urban mobility.
