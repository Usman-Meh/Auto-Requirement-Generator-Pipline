Why choose this programme
The Department has a long tradition in photochemistry and is still a leader in this field.
This programme is the first and only one in Italy to be taught entirely in English by high-calibre teachers.
It offers you a stimulating environment where you will have the opportunity to meet internationally renowned scientists.
The internship offers you state-of-the-art research experiences, also thanks to the teaching staff’s extensive network of collaborations.
We will prepare you for a career in high-tech companies in energy, health, environment, or for entry into prestigious PhD programmes.
Professional profiles
Research and development CHEMIST, specialising in the fields of photochemistry and of functional and structural materials.
Role in a work context:
The role of a research and development chemist consists in dealing with innovative aspects involving, on the one hand, the synthesis, characterisation and modelling of systems and materials with desired properties and, on the other hand, the modification of existing systems and materials with a view to improving their applications.
Naturally, research activities can be carried out at the university or in public or private research centres. For this purpose, a PhD is essential.
A research and development chemist prepares and characterises chemical systems, including complex ones, conducts analytical and structural analyses, and can also perform the following functions and tasks:
-Designing and synthesising new molecules and supramolecular systems with modular properties for optical, redox or chemical stimuli
-Designing, synthesising and classifying new materials capable of performing targeted and valuable tasks
-Using green chemistry techniques with low environmental impact
-Designing and manufacturing new materials, both functional and structural, with predetermined properties, including through the use of modelling techniques that predict material performance
-Working on materials that are already used in industrial production and research in order to improve their properties and expand their field of use
-Classifying the physical, chemical-physical and mechanical properties of different classes of materials
-Using sophisticated tools for the classification of molecules and materials (equipment for laser flash photolysis, X-ray diffraction, electrochemical investigation and microscopy)
-Managing quality and safety control in laboratories and work environments; for these specific areas (quality and safety), additional skills need to be acquired through post-graduate training programmes
-Dealing with the synthesis, design and evaluation of the use of new materials of interest for the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, electronic, biotechnological, food, medical and energetic sectors.
In both public and private sectors, graduates may, throughout their professional career, take on management and co-ordination roles.
Skills/expertise associated with the role:
In order to carry out the roles described above, specific knowledge, abilities and specialised skills in the technical-scientific field are required. Greater specialisation may be necessary, as well as learning skills in one or more professional sectors of specialisation.
In particular, the following skills and expertise will be required:
-Self-learning and continuous professional development
-Adequate transversal communication and relational skills
-Organisational, management and planning skills, in accordance with the assigned level of independence and responsibility, with the organisational and working methods adopted and with the main interlocutors (colleagues, other professionals and public and/or private clients)
-Ability to as certain and assess the current status of the projects and systems on which they must operate,
-Knowledge of the design and synthesis methods of materials capable of performing predetermined tasks
-Ability to assess the effects of material interactions with light
-Ability to choose the most effective techniques for the classification of materials and of their physical, chemical-physical and mechanical properties
-Ability to select and apply modelling techniques that predict material performance
-Ability to identify aspects requiring attention with the aim of improving properties and expanding the field of use of materials that are already used in industrial production and research
-Ability to apply the knowledge acquired during the two-year master's degree to develop original ideas in a research and/or application context
Career Opportunities:
-Universities and public and private research bodies (PhD programme, Professional Master's Programme, specialisation school)
-Basic Chemical Industries
-Polymer industries
-Pharmaceutical industries
-Biomedical industries
-Agrochemical industries
-Colourant and Pigment industries
-Packaging industries
-Food industries
-Biotechnological industries
-Textile industries
-Cosmetic industries
-Ceramic industries
-Electronics industries
-Scientific education/communication agencies
Analytical and quality control CHEMIST, specialising in the fields of photochemistry and of functional and structural materials.
Role in a work context:
The role of an analytical and quality control chemist involves dealing with aspects related to the analysis and control of raw materials and products in various product sectors. Students will have opportunities to find a position in the industrial field, but also in sectors such as customs laboratories, cultural heritage preservation, environmental and local protection agencies, and in the forensic field.
An analysis and control chemist can hold the following roles:
-Quality control laboratory technician in charge of incoming or outgoing products (end products);
-Production technician, especially in sectors where ongoing product assessmentis planned (e.g. pharmaceutical sector, pigments sector, etc.)
-Laboratory and occupational safety technician;
-Instrumental lab technician, in both routine and sophisticated laboratories, involved in the classification of new materials and the recognition of known molecules or solids
-Scientific instrumentation and chemicals sales representative
Skills/expertise associated with the role:
In order to carry out the roles described above, specific knowledge, abilities and specialised skills in the technical-scientific field are required. Greater specialisation may be necessary, as well as learning skills in one or more professional sectors of specialisation
An analysis and control chemist has the following skills and expertise:
-Extensive and varied knowledge in the field of analytical and instrumental chemistry
-Familiarity with the classification techniques for molecular and polymeric systems, both routine and innovative, which can be used in the industrial field, in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical/food sectors, and in the electronics industry
-Computational and computer skills
-Familiarity with the safety and hazard regulations for chemical compounds
-The ability to update their professional skills, organise their time and knowing how to work towards meeting goals
-Capable of building relationships at work and interacting with experts from other sectors
-Capable of adapting to new work situations and to changes in the areas in which they are involved
Career Opportunities:
-Regional control agencies, national health institutes, civil defence, forensics, customs offices etc.
-Service companies (consulting, restoration, forensic chemistry)
-Outsourcing laboratories for companies (in the pharmaceutical, pigments, agrochemical fields etc.)
-Chemical companies in general
CHEMIST in a managerial role (also in a freelance capacity), specialising in the fields of photochemistry and of functional and structural materials.
Role in a work context:
To work freelance in this field in Italy, students must pass the state exam and register with the
