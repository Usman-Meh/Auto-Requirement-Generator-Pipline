Specialist facilities
Our
Loughton Campus
is perfectly located, providing access to both the rich, cultural diversity of London and an attractive and peaceful setting in which to study.
We are just a five-minute walk from London Underground station, Debden, where you can travel in only thirty minutes to Central London, West End theatres and mainline train stations including the Eurostar.
We have three sites at our Loughton Campus – Hatfields, Roding House and Unit Four. Hatfields is a beautiful Georgian dower house, set in five acres of lawns with orchards, flowerbeds and a small lake, providing an idyllic atmosphere for study, relaxation and performance.
Just a short walk from Hatfields is Roding House, a £1.3 million facility containing 10 rehearsal rooms, a green room/café, a sound recording studio and a video editing suite, and our costume department.
Next to Roding House, Unit Four is a £1.5 million facility which is home to the Stage & Production Management department. The Unit contains a large workshop, paint shop, prop shop, prop storage facilities and teaching spaces.
Our on-site Corbett Theatre is named in honour of Harry H Corbett, a key member of Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop and early benefactor of East 15. It is used extensively for student productions and is a practical training hub for our BA Stage and Production Management students.
The building is a medieval tithe barn that was dismantled and transported to Hatfields in the 1960s. These unusual origins create a unique performance space with a special atmosphere. Renovated to include full technical facilities, tiered seating for 130 people and fitted dressing rooms, the theatre provides an excellent resource for public productions, while the adjacent Bar and Café provides a social meeting point for students and staff.

Students are encouraged to reflect on their course experiences and training and to prepare themselves for further professional and cultural challenges after graduation. You will use the research and writing skills you have learned in years one and two to consider new ideas in greater depth and to develop the ability to express arguments through a process supported by relevant research and source materials. This process will culminate in the third term when you will present your Personal Development Journal.

Teaching
Year 1
In your first year, you will focus on acting, voice, singing, movement and contextual studies and explore your own creativity through work focussed on co-operation, responsiveness to others and the ensemble. In addition you will:
Develop the skills required for objective self-assessment, recreating through observation, research and improvisation
Concentrate on individual character study and work on larger community-based projects with an emphasis on psychological realism
The first year culminates in a unique, large-scale ‘Living History' project, in which you study, understand and live the lives of others through periods of conflict.
Year 2
Your second year is a journey of maturation as study moves from improvisation to text and from the examination of self to the exploration of character. We focus on:
Technical skills such as movement, voice and singing which are integrated into the work, and you start to build characters independently
Opportunities to take responsibility for your own creative work and adapt to the differing demands of project and director
Multiple screen and radio projects throughout the year
Specific focus on Contemporary British Playwrights, continuously updated to reflect relevant British culture
Varying work from nineteenth century naturalism, to exploring the textual and psychological complexities of Shakespeare, plus learning to devise and break the fourth wall through projects such as Brecht, Cabaret and Commedia dell'Arte
Year 3
Your final year focuses on understanding the demands of the professional performance industries before you graduate. You deliver a wide variety of plays to extend your performance repertoire, produce performance-tailored short films as well as work with experienced industry professionals in recorded media. Productions enable you to develop advanced acting skills as well as to understand the research demands and commitment required for different roles, and place a strong emphasis on actor contribution within the ensemble.
In addition, specialised professional development workshops help you understand the administrative aspects of your future profession, including:
Audition technique
CV and letter writing
Tax and self-employment
Marketing and promoting yourself as an actor
You also undertake an Industry Showcase for an invited audience of influential agents, casting directors, film, voiceover, TV and theatre directors. East 15 continually liaises with industry professionals to ensure the format for the event accords with the changing landscape of the industry.
