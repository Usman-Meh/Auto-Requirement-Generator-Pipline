Our MSD in Public Health offers you a unique opportunity to undertake research in a variety of public health contexts e.g. schools, hospitals and community settings. You will be offered opportunities to access our Masters level research methods modules to provide a sound foundation of specific research knowledge and skills. In addition, you will have access to the University's Proficio research training scheme which allows you to choose training programmes that meet the requirements of your own research topics and methodologies.
This MSD is offered on a 1 year full-time or 2 year part-time basis, plus up to one year of completion. Some people choose to do an MSD before applying to undertake a PhD in order to develop their research skills and knowledge and to demonstrate their self-discipline and time management skills to potential supervisors or funders.
The School of Health and Social Care is proud to work closely with our Service User Reference Group (SURG).  SURG is made up of service users, carers, and volunteers who generously share their first-hand experiences of health and social care.  We work collaboratively with SURG to design our courses to ensure that we truly are putting the needs of patients and clients at the heart of what we do.  SURG are involved as part of our course application processes and often form part of our interview panels.  This helps us to be confident that we are selecting the right applicants for the course and their future careers.  SURG members also support the delivery of our teaching sessions and research activity, which means you'll benefit from an insight into their lived experiences of living with a diagnosis, health condition, or circumstance.  You'll find that not only does your clinical knowledge expand, but your empathy, compassion and ability to advocate develops also.
Why we're great.
We specialise in applied, multidisciplinary research that addresses issues of national and international concern to health policy and practice and related fields. We have research interest groups in ‘Developing Professional Practice' and ‘Applied Health Research', and host the NIHR Research Design Service for the East of England.
Within our School, our educational provision meets professional regulatory requirements and achieves high standards. We do so by having staff that are multi-professional, including clinically-qualified lecturers, sociologists and social policy and management specialists, so they have clinical and academic credibility.
A unique feature of our School is that many of our staff work with local National Health Service (NHS) Trusts and other local agencies, which enhances our grasp of the contemporary links between academic research, the major issues of the day and practice.
Our expert staff
Within the School of Health and Social Care, we have a number of registered Health Professionals and Medical Sociologists with an interest in Public Health who are also research supervisors. This provides you with the clinical awareness and guidance alongside the scientific rigour necessary to undertake such a MSD. Your supervisor(s) will guide you in developing your research plans and support you in your self-directed learning. You will also have two supervisory panels a year (one for part-time students) which will allow your progress to be monitored in a more formal manner.
Specialist facilities
The School has access to the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) building. We also have an open-access reception area where staff and students meet for social events.
As part of the University, you have access to our state-of-the-art library and the very latest equipment and IT facilities to assist you with the effective learning and acquisition of new skills. As a School, we have purpose built facilities where you can meet to discuss your progress and ongoing work.
Our staff offer approachable support at all levels. Our university student support network can also offer you help with personal and study issues during your time with us.
You also have access to an excellent theatre and sports and social club experiences at Essex.
Your future
Our Graduates have gone on to take up posts in both clinical and management positions in Trusts, hospitals and care organisations as well as in local and county councils.

Structure
Course structure
A research degree doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a dissertation or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100
