Genetics is at the forefront of modern biology, driving progress in medicine and synthetic biology. Thanks to recent developments in genetic analysis and manipulation, we are now able to explore the interaction between genes and the environment at an unprecedented level: from developmental processes to the epigenetic effects of the environment in our genome.
Teaching on our BSc Genetics course focuses on real-world applications, including medicine, biotechnology and genomics. The study of genetics includes understanding how genes are passed from one generation to the next, how DNA works, and the effects of variation and natural selection.
You study topics including:
The structural organisation of a genome, the process of transcription, and the regulation of gene expression
The contribution of genome science to the diagnosis and prevention of disease
Evolutionary biology, from Darwin to genomics
Molecular cell biology
The human genome
Bioinformatics and genomics
You will be trained in genetics and genomics. Depending on your choice of modules, you will focus on biomedical aspects, on the study of genomes or on a combination of both areas. Our optional modules also cover a wide range of topics including plant biotechnology, stem cells, cancer and virology.
Some of the most exciting and important advances in biology are now being made in the field of genetics, and at Essex you have the opportunity to be part of this revolution.

Offer Holder Days
If you receive an undergraduate offer to study with us in October 2024 and live in the UK, you will receive an email invitation to book onto one of our Offer Holder Days. Our Colchester Campus Offer Holder Days run from February to May 2024 on various Wednesdays and Saturdays, and our Southend Campus events run in April and May. These events provide the opportunity to meet your department, tour our campus and accommodation, and chat to current students. To support your attendance, we are offering a travel bursary, allowing you to claim up to £150 as reimbursement for travel expenses. For further information about Offer Holder Days, including terms and conditions and eligibility criteria for our travel bursary, please visit our
webpage.
If you are an overseas offer-holder, you will be invited to attend one of our virtual events. However, you are more than welcome to join us at one of our in-person Offer Holder Days if you are able to - we will let you know in your invite email how you can do this.

The University makes every effort to ensure that this information on its programme specification is accurate and up-to-date. Exceptionally it can be necessary to make changes, for example to courses, facilities or fees. Examples of such reasons might include, but are not limited to: strikes, other industrial action, staff illness, severe weather, fire, civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist attack or threat of terrorist attack (whether declared or not), natural disaster, restrictions imposed by government or public authorities, epidemic or pandemic disease, failure of public utilities or transport systems or the withdrawal/reduction of funding. Changes to courses may for example consist of variations to the content and method of delivery of programmes, courses and other services, to discontinue programmes, courses and other services and to merge or combine programmes or courses. The University will endeavour to keep such changes to a minimum, and will also keep students informed appropriately by updating our
programme specifications
. The University would inform and engage with you if your course was to be discontinued, and would provide you with options, where appropriate, in line with our Compensation and Refund Policy.
The full Procedures, Rules and Regulations of the University governing how it operates are set out in the Charter, Statutes and
Ordinances and in the University Regulations, Policy and Procedures.
