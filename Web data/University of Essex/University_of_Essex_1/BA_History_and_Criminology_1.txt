This course has been temporarily suspended for the academic year 2025-26.
In this History and Criminology degree you are encouraged to consider the ways in which histories of crime and the discipline of criminology overlap and influence each other.
Criminologists engage with some of the most pressing issues, decisions and dilemmas facing societies today. When you study criminology, you explore the nature of crime, criminal justice and punishment within wider social contexts and study an exciting range of topics, from the impact of computer games on crime, to terrorism and illegal migration, to policing and controlling society.
As a student of history, you also discover both the early modern and modern periods, and explore challenging questions concerning the impact of political, social and cultural change on individuals, social groups, and regions. This degree offers the flexibility to choose from a wide range of optional modules about subjects close to home and further afield.
Assessed coursework generally consists of essays, concept studies, critical commentaries, research proposals, and a 15,000-word dissertation. Students usually attend a two-hour seminar for each module each week. Seminar groups/workshops which would usually have about 15 students.
Our
School of Philosophical, Historical and Interdiciplinary Studies
has developed a strong research and teaching profile. Our staff are amongst world leaders in their fields and we have strong links with the Essex Record Office, which is one of the best county record offices in the UK.

Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course.Â A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules fromÂ which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options

Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the

COMPONENT 01: COMPULSORY
Rebellious Pasts: Challenging and Creating Histories
(30 CREDITS)
The past is never dead. Itâs not even pastâ. In a world of conspiracy theories, toppling statues, and âculture warsâ, the novelist William Faulknerâs most famous line resonates more than ever. Across the globe, History is co-opted to multiple causes and used to justify contradictory positions. Such uses of History often rely on myths, stereotypes, and misunderstandings. How can we separate political belief, personal opinion, and false information about the past from historical knowledge and understanding? 

Rebellious Pasts looks at the creation, consolidation, and operation of historical myths and stereotypes â and at how we, as historians, can use the tools of our trade to identify and challenge misleading representations of the past, replacing them with richer forms of understanding. The module helps you to develop the critical mindset needed to analyse historical arguments wherever you find them, but also the constructive skills essential to researching and writing your own histories. It combines lectures and seminars exploring how history âworksâ in different contexts with archive visits and library workshops that expose you to the raw materials of History.  

On Rebellious Pasts, you will undertake self-directed research drawing upon digitized collections, archives, and heritage sector institutions, and translate your findings into accessible public history artefacts. At its heart, History is the refusal to accept easy assumptions and the insistence on negotiating with evidence, no matter how tricky that is. By the end of the module, you will understand why History is a rebellious discipline â and how to harness its unruly powers.

COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY
Introduction to Crime, Law and Society
(30 CREDITS)
What are different forms of crime? What is the role of criminal justice? And how effective are penal sanctions? We provide a critical introduction to the problem of, and responses to, crime. You examine the history of criminological ideas, Britainâs criminal justice system, and current debates on crime and control.
View Introduction to Crime, Law and Society on our Module Directory
COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY
Researching Social Life
(15 CREDITS)
What research methods do sociologists use? And what are the methodologies underpinning them?  Wish to learn how to critically evaluate social research?  And receive training in collecting quantitative and qualitative data? We study the principles of social science investigation and how to carry out original research.
View Researching Social Life on our Module Directory
COMPONENT 04: COMPULSORY
Crime, Control, and the City
(15 CREDITS)
City space matters to criminology: it is the physical and symbolic locus where crime and disorder take place, where social conflicts manifest and aggravate, where social control and resistance to it are exercised, and where broader harms and suffering are produced.
This module examines local responses to the governance of crime, seeking to understand conceptions of urban âdisorderâ by attending closely to how communities experience rapidly changing and expanding city environments. The course contrasts public experiences of crime and crime control in the context of highly securitised, enclaved, and surveilled urban spaces in London, Karachi, Maputo and other unequal global cities. Drawing on theories and methodologies from criminology, sociology, and urban studies, the course asks you to consider the possible futures of public and private urban landscapes in the context of rapid urban development.

COMPONENT 01: COMPULSORY
Exploring History: Research Workshop
(30 CREDITS)
History is never neutral. It is always a response to the questions historians choose to ask of the past. Historians decide what questions to ask for all kinds of reasons â out of interest, to aid understanding of specific aspects of the world around them, because certain types of evidence are available, or because the work of other historians has prompted them to think anew. These questions shape the evidence that historians look at, and therefore the kinds of answers they are likely to find. History is always a trialogue between the historian, the questions, and the evidence â and it is therefore a product of the present as well as the past. 

Exploring History focuses on the relationship between questions and evidence in forming historical knowledge. Consolidating and extending the skills and abilities introduced in the Year 1 module Rebellious Pasts, it charts the development of the historical discipline, examines specific examples of historical debate (or what is known as âhistoriographyâ), and introduces you to different types of historical evidence and ways of analysing this evidence. Through exploring historical debates you will gain new insight into how history is researched, written, and contested. Through in-depth examinations of different kinds of primary sources you will develop new skills in historical research. Finally, you will bring these abilities together to research and write an extended essay on a topic of your choice, developing and practising the skills you will employ in your final year History Research Project.
View Exploring History: Research Workshop on our Module Directory
COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY
Sociology of Crime and Control
(30 CREDITS)
You will examine key theories and trends in criminological thought, including the historical development of criminology and some of the more recent critiques. The themes of causation, criminalisation, correction and control run throughout the theoretical perspectives and are considered alongside some specific examples of criminal activity and organisation. Examples range from the individually-experienced through the structural inequalities relevant to understanding gender, ethnicity and crime and include the global dimensions.
This module has been designed to enable students to integrate their subject knowledge with an understanding of sustainable development, acquiring the skills and competencies essential for addressing the urgent sustainability challenges of the 21stÂ century.

What effect does globalisation have on crime and justice? How do we deal with global crime issues, like terrorism or illegal migration? Can we prevent large-scale crime, such as genocide? Study the changing nature of criminology, looking at contemporary developments, alongside the problem of balancing human rights with human security.
