How can biological processes and organisms be used in the development of new technologies? Biotechnology enables us to improve practices in diverse fields including genetics, agriculture, bioremediation, immunology, diagnostics, energy production, and age-assisted living.
Our course provides you with knowledge, understanding and hands-on experience in modern biotechnology, and with practical insights into current commercial applications. It creates access to a broad range of career opportunities in this rapidly growing key technology.
You will learn about and appraise the approaches that can be used to address the challenges facing our planet, including:
The development of biofuels, pharmaceuticals and crops to support and feed the growing human population
Industrial, plant and medical biotechnology
Gene and protein technology
Synthetic biology
Bioinformatics
The course has a very high proportion of practical work that provides valuable experience for your career. Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. Therefore to ensure your course is as relevant and up-to-date as possible, your module structure may be subject to change. Your research project will immerse you in a research environment, allowing you to conduct your research alongside our expert academics and PhD students in shared labs.

our academics'
wide range of expertise and research on important national and international problems using cutting-edge techniques.
The University of Essex has a
Women's Network
to support female staff and students, and our School was awarded the
Athena Swan Silver Award
in October 2020, which reflects the work carried out by staff in our School to continue to improve equality, including a mentorship scheme, support for postdoctoral research staff, and financial help towards childcare costs for academics who wish to attend conferences.
Specialist facilities
Recent investment has provided modern facilities for functional genomics, computational biology, and imaging biological systems. On our course you have the opportunity to:
Work in an open and friendly department, with shared staff-student social spaces
Conduct your research alongside leading academics and PhD students in shared labs
Learn to use state-of-the-art
equipment
Your future
Our graduates are well placed to find a
career
in the ever-growing bio-based economy, and postgraduate study is often a requirement for becoming a researcher, scientist, academic journal editor and to work in some public bodies or private companies.
Many of our Masters students progress to study for their PhD, and we offer numerous
studentships
to support our students in their studies.
We work with the University's Careers Services to help you find out about further work experience, internships, placements, and voluntary opportunities.
“I chose to study MSc Biotechnology at Essex because of its outstanding academic staff, modern facilities, worldwide community, and the environment of equality. It definitely helped me to improve both professionally and personally, and broadened my horizon. What I enjoyed most was working on the research project. Along with hard work and learning substantial skills, I made many friends. Microbial biotechnology is my passion and I dream to use the knowledge I acquired to contribute to the development of Peru, my home country.”
Pamela Canales Mormontoy, MSc Biotechnology, 2016

English language requirements
If English is not your first language, we require IELTS 6.5 overall with a minimum  score of 5.5 in all components.
If you do not meet our IELTS requirements then you may be able to complete a
pre-sessional English
pathway
that enables you to start your course without retaking IELTS.
Additional Notes
The University uses academic selection criteria to determine an applicant’s ability to
successfully complete a course at the University of Essex. Where appropriate, we may ask
for specific information relating to previous modules studied or work experience.
Structure
Course structure
All of the modules listed below provide an example of what is on offer from the current academic year. Our Programme Specification provides further details of the course structure for the current academic year.
Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The course content is therefore reviewed on an annual basis to ensure our courses remain up-to-date so modules listed are subject to change.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100
4
FY
The department or school the module will be taught by.
In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History.
The module number.
The
UK academic level
of the module.
A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.
A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.
A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification.
