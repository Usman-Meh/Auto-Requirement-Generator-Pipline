Our BSc Biomedical Science (including Foundation Year) could be suitable for you if your academic qualifications do not yet meet our entry requirements for a three-year version of our life sciences courses and you want a programme that improves your skills to support your academic performance.
Open to UK and EU applicants, this four-year course includes a Foundation Year (known as Year Zero) which is delivered by our
Essex Pathways Department
, followed by a further three years of study in our
School of Life Sciences.
During Year Zero you will study on our
Life Sciences Pathway
which will cover topics such as an Introduction to Biology, Chemistry for Biology, and Mathematics and Statistics for Life Sciences. At the end of Year Zero, all students who pass the Life Sciences Pathway will have a choice of which course to progress with. As well as BSc Biomedical Science, students on the Life Sciences Pathway could also study BSc Biological Sciences or BSc Marine Biology.
From Year One of BSc Biomedical Science you will explore the causes and diagnosis of diseases and the effectiveness of the medicines that cure them. You apply the concepts of biochemistry and cell biology to the study of health and disease in the human body. Our multidisciplinary approach means you learn skills that are at the forefront of advanced in medical research. You will learn modern lab techniques, take part in specialist field-trips, and play your own part in adding to the ever-growing knowledge within biomedical science.
We are the top university in the country for providing NHS placements as part of our applied biomedical science course. You will gain fast-track career progression within the NHS by studying with us. At Essex, our research focuses on genetic diseases, infection and immunity, and age-associated conditions such as cancer.

"The best part of my course was the support I received from Essex in completing my placement year, enabling me to jump straight into work after graduating. I have become increasingly grateful for the quality of modules on offer as each has proven to be extremely useful and relevant in the workplace. I am a molecular pathology and genetics biomedical scientist, where my main role is to perform serological and PCR techniques for the detection, confirmation and sequencing of infectious pathogens."

Entry requirements
UK entry requirements
UK and EU applicants:
All applications for degree courses with a foundation year will be considered individually, whether you
think you might not have the grades to enter the first year of a degree course;
have non-traditional qualifications or experience (e.g. you haven’t studied A-levels or a BTEC);
are returning to university after some time away from education; or
are looking for more support during the transition into university study.
Standard offer:
Our standard offer is 72 UCAS tariff points from at least two full A-levels, or equivalent, to include a science subject.
Examples of the above tariff may include:
A-levels: DDD (including a science subject)
BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma: MMP (in a science subject)
T-levels: Pass with E in core, depending on subject studied - advice on acceptability can be provided.
For this course we require either
Level 3 (i.e. A-level, BTEC, etc.) scientific study. Considered science subjects from all qualifications include Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Psychology, Maths, Geography, Sports Science and Applied Science.
or
Two GCSEs from Chemistry, Physics, and Biology at grade B/6 (or equivalent). Other science-related GCSE subjects may be considered on a case-by-case basis.
All applicants must also hold GCSE Maths and Science at grade C/4 or above (or equivalent). We
may
be able to consider a pass in an OFQUAL regulated Level 2 Functional Skills Maths where you cannot meet the requirements for Maths at GCSE level. However, you are advised to try to retake GCSE Mathematics if possible as this will better prepare you for university study and future employment.
If you are unsure whether you meet the entry criteria, please
get in touch
for advice.
Mature applicants and non-traditional academic backgrounds:
We welcome applications from mature students (over 21) and students with non-traditional academic backgrounds (might not have gone on from school to take level 3 qualifications).  We will consider your educational and employment history, along with your personal statement and reference, to gain a rounded view of your suitability for the course.
We might not need evidence of level 3 scientific study where you have relevant work experience in a scientific field, or where you have previous successful study at degree level.
You will still need to meet our GCSE requirements.
International applicants:
Essex Pathways Department is unable to accept applications from international students. Foundation pathways for international students are available at the
University of Essex International College
and are delivered and awarded by Kaplan, in partnership with the University of Essex. Successful completion will enable you to progress to the relevant degree course at the University of Essex.
International & EU entry requirements
We accept a wide range of qualifications from applicants studying in the EU and other countries. Get in touch with any questions you may have about the qualifications we accept. Remember to tell us about the qualifications you have already completed or are currently taking.

Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code

Are all scientific advances good news? Investigate the ethics and impact of new research, from discussing how limited economic resource restricts accessibility of new treatments, to how health professionals can best help the public make informed decisions. Even research as exciting as stem cell technology, with the possibility it carries of curing genetic illness, must be considered from an ethical point of view.

Changes to courses may for example consist of variations to the content and method of delivery of programmes, courses and other services, to discontinue programmes, courses and other services and to merge or combine programmes or courses. The University will endeavour to keep such changes to a minimum, and will also keep students informed appropriately by updating our
