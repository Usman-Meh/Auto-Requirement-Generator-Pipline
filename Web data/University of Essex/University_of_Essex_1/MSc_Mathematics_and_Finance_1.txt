Based in:
Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science (School of)
One of our most popular courses, MSc Mathematics and Finance allows those with a background in mathematics to study finance. Since finance routinely involves modelling and evaluating risk, asset pricing and price forecasting, mathematics has become an indispensable tool for this study.
You explore topics including:
Models and mathematics in portfolio management
Risk management in modern banking
Financial modelling
Actuarial modelling
Applied statistics
In recent years, finance has been one of the areas where high-calibre mathematicians have been in great demand. With the advent of powerful and yet economically accessible computing, online trading has become a common activity, but many have realised that a certain amount of mathematics is necessary to be successful in such fields.
Our interdisciplinary research recognises that mathematics, including what can be very abstract mathematics, is an essential part of research in many other disciplines.
Our
School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science
has an international reputation in many areas including semi-group theory, optimisation, probability, applied statistics, bioinformatics and mathematical biology.
We are genuinely innovative and student-focused. Our research groups are working on a broad range of collaborative areas tackling real-world issues. Here are a few examples:
Our data scientists carefully consider how not to lie, and how not to get lied to with data. Interpreting data correctly is especially important because much of our data science research is applied directly or indirectly to social policies, including health, care and education.
We do practical research with financial data (for example, assessing the risk of collapse of the UK's banking system) as well as theoretical research in financial instruments such as insurance policies or asset portfolios.
We also research how physical processes develop in time and space. Applications of this range from modelling epilepsy to modelling electronic cables.
Our optimisation experts work out how to do the same job with less resource, or how to do more with the same resource.
Our pure maths group are currently working on two new funded projects entitled ‘Machine learning for recognising tangled 3D objects' and ‘Searching for gems in the landscape of cyclically presented groups'.
We also do research into mathematical education and use exciting technologies such as electroencephalography or eye tracking to measure exactly what a learner is feeling. Our research aims to encourage the implementation of ‘the four Cs' of modern education, which are critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity.
Why we're great.
Maths has become an indispensable tool for finance – our course allows those with a background in maths to study finance.
Our students run a renowned Maths Support Centre which offers advice to other departments at Essex and far beyond – we have calls from as far afield as China.
Gain key employability skills include data analysis, use of algorithms and mathematical modelling.
Our expert staff
Our School is committed to providing you with the academic support you need to succeed. Our flexible policy means some staff are always available, whilst others maintain regular drop-in times. Staff are always happy to arrange appointments for longer discussions, and no issue is too big or too small.
Our academics are strongly committed to research and teaching. They have published several well-regarded articles and books and are leaders in their fields, with papers appearing in journals such as
Journal of American Statistical Association, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Bernoulli, and Scandinavian Journal of Statistics
.
Specialist facilities
Reach your potential and enhance your chances of success with maths and statistics classes, workshops, drop-in clinics and online resources provided by the
Skills for Success team
We have our own computer labs for the exclusive use of students in the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science – in addition to your core maths modules, you gain computing knowledge of software including Matlab and Maple
We host events and seminars throughout the year
Our students run a lively Mathematics Society, an active and social group where you can explore your interest in your subject with other students
Your future
There is undoubtedly a shortage of mathematicians in general, and an even greater one of those with knowledge of finance.
Our course produces graduates with a sound background in mathematics and finance. Key employability skills include computing, use of algorithms, data analysis, mathematical modelling and understanding financial statements.
Our graduates are highly sought after by a range of employers and find employment in financial services, scientific computation, decision making support and government, risk assessment, statistics, education and other sectors.
We also offer supervision for PhD, MPhil and MSc by Dissertation. We have an international reputation in many areas such as semi-group theory, optimisation, probability, applied statistics, bioinformatics and mathematical biology, and our staff are strongly committed to research and to the promotion of graduate activities.
We additionally work with our
Employability and Careers Centre
to help you find out about further work experience, internships, placements, and voluntary opportunities.

Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100
4
