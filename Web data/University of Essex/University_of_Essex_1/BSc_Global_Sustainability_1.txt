Our BSc Global Sustainability course is focused on addressing the grand challenges facing Planet Earth and its living systems. This course will involve you in problem solving at a global scale and equip you with the tools needed to address complex problems through a highly innovative and interdisciplinary degree.
You will study the interaction of humans and nature at the local, regional and global level, whilst acquiring the data handling skills needed for a future career in sustainability. You will be trained with the knowledge and skills to tackle the most complex problems faced by our planet, led by our research-intensive academic staff.
Based in our
School of Life Sciences
, our BSc Global Sustainability course cuts across multiple disciplines. You can choose optional modules from other subject areas including economics, philosophy, psychology, sociology, and politics, each taught by internationally recognised experts in their fields.
You will harness the world-leading expertise from across the University of Essex and develop the tools to improve humanity's future. You will have the opportunity to join our ongoing work with governmental, non-governmental and commercial partners with impact at local (eg Colchester Oyster Fishery), national (eg CEFAS) and International (eg Mars Corporation) scales.
The grand challenges we will tackle include the interacting climate, biodiversity and nature crises as well as pollution, inequality and social injustice. Together, we will understand how to manage these challenges and plan appropriate responses to them. You will study the relationship between the environment, human cultures and values, while working with stakeholders on the analysis, resolution and communication of complex global issues.
The diverse opportunities offered by this course include, as with all our degrees, options to spend a year abroad or in industry. This allows you the flexibility to shape a degree to suit your interests.
We’re ranked 54th (14th in UK) for promoting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal for climate action (Times Higher Education Impact Rankings 2024).
