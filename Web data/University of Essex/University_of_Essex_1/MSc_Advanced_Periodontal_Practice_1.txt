Do you have the enhanced skills in advanced care that are needed in the new dental contract? Dental practices who do are likely to be commissioned to provide specialised services under the proposed new dental contract. Periodontology is just one of those specialised services you could be commissioned to do.
If you are a registered UK dental hygienist or dental hygienist/therapist, our MSc Advanced Periodontal Practice course provides an educational route for you to acquire advanced skills and knowledge in periodontology:
Gain experience in our purpose-built dental skills labs and clinical patient care facilities
Make your studies fit around your busy working life through our flexible study options
Expand your knowledge and interests in a broad range of dental disciplines
Learn from experienced clinicians who provide expert oral health care in clinical settings
Reinforce and enhance the skills which are required for everyday clinical practice
You gain a broad and critical understanding of the key concepts underlying clinical periodontal practice. At Essex, you critically appraise research findings and develop your own evidence-based practice.
The School of Health and Social Care is proud to work closely with our Service User Reference Group (SURG).  SURG is made up of service users, carers, and volunteers who generously share their first-hand experiences of health and social care.  We work collaboratively with SURG to design our courses to ensure that we truly are putting the needs of patients and clients at the heart of what we do.  SURG are involved as part of our course application processes and often form part of our interview panels.  This helps us to be confident that we are selecting the right applicants for the course and their future careers.  SURG members also support the delivery of our teaching sessions and research activity, which means you'll benefit from an insight into their lived experiences of living with a diagnosis, health condition, or circumstance.  You'll find that not only does your clinical knowledge expand, but your empathy, compassion and ability to advocate develops also.
If you are a dentist we also offer our
MSc Periodontology
, which provides an educational route, by credit accumulation, to acquire the abilities and knowledge of a dentist with enhanced skills.
Why we're great.
Reinforce and enhance your skills required for everyday clinical practice, by learning from experienced clinicians
Acquire a broad and critical understanding of the key concepts underlying clinical periodontal practice
Gain advanced skills and knowledge in our purpose-built facilities for developing dental skills and patient care

The MSc Advanced Periodontal Practice degree has propelled my career and enabled me to develop on my clinical skill set with a greater level of knowledge on the management of periodontal disease, in relation to appropriate assessment, diagnosis and treatment planning of complex cases; and an appreciation of the importance that research has and the impact of evidence- based practice in obtaining successful of treatment outcomes.

Structure
Course structure
Postgraduate study is the chance to take your education to the next level. These carefully selected modules will give you the chance to explore, question, and create powerful ideas. Picked to give you an extensive and in-depth education, they'll equip you with the specialist knowledge, vital transferrable skills, and the confidence to make a genuine difference to the world around you.
Our MSc Advanced Periodontal Practice provides an educational route, by credit accumulation, for you to acquire advanced skills and knowledge in periodontology.
We're reactive, we're pioneering, we never stand still, so modules might change from year to year in response to new developments and innovation. Those listed below show how a typical course might look, but more detail on course structure, including details of all optional modules, is available on our
Programme Specification
.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means

Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory

Compulsory with Options

Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
