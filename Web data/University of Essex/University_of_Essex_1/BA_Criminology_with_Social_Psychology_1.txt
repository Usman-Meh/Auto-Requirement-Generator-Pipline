Sociology and Criminology
How do we understand crime? Should crime be punished? Criminologists engage with some of the most pressing issues, decisions and dilemmas facing societies today. On our course you explore the nature of crime, criminal justice and punishment within wider social contexts.
Our course provides a thorough training in the foundations of criminology, exploring the nature of crime, criminals, and criminal justice within wider social and psychological contexts. Social psychological approaches are increasingly crucial in understanding the interpersonal dynamics in crime control organisations, as well as exploring questions of criminal motivation.
You will explore topics including:
Crime and its control
Power
Identity
You also have the opportunity to complete a supervised dissertation on a topic that inspires you, encouraging you to think differently and connect with live issues and debates, and preparing you for your graduate career.
Our BA Criminology is run by the
Department of Sociology and Criminology
, which is 2nd in UK for research power in sociology (Times Higher Education research power measure, Research Excellence Framework 2021).
Why we're great.
We pioneered sociologically informed approaches to criminology — Essex is where it all started
Top 15 in the UK for sociology in the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2024

Study abroad
Your education extends beyond the university campus. We support you in expanding your education through offering the opportunity to spend a year or a term studying abroad at one of our partner universities. The four-year version of our degree allows you to spend the third year abroad or employed on a placement abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the three-year course.
Studying abroad allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.
If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university
Placement year
You can also undertake a placement year in which you gain relevant work experience within an external business, giving you a competitive edge in the graduate job market and providing you with key contacts within the industry. You will be responsible for finding your placement, but with support and guidance provided by both your department and our Employability and Careers Centre.
Training social scientists of the future
Through our Q-Step Affiliate Status, we offer you the opportunity to follow a
specialised pathway
that embeds quantitative methods in your degree. Successful completion of specified modules entitles you to receive the qualifier ‘(Applied Quantitative Methods)' at the end of your degree title, for example BA Sociology (Applied Quantitative Methods) and this will appear on your transcript. You can also receive student bursaries to go on work placements, helping you stand out when applying for jobs.
If you complete a placement year you'll only pay 20% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year.
Our expert staff
You are taught by a team of award-winning internationally renowned scholars widely regarded as leading experts in their fields.
Criminology at Essex is taught by an outstanding team including:  Professor Eamonn Carrabine (editor of the British Journal of Criminology),  Professor Pamela Cox (a consultant for the Victims' Commissioner), Professor Pete Fussey (an advisor to the Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner), Dr Kat Hadjimatheou (an advisor to the Home Office on domestic abuse), Prof Anna Sergi (an advisor to Interpol on organised crime) and Dr Sobie Kaker (member of Karachi Urban Lab).
All lecturing staff are actively researching at the cutting edge of their respective disciplines and bring the very latest research findings into the classroom. All are prominent writers and the criminology team collectively authored the best-selling criminology textbook, ‘Criminology: A Sociological Introduction', used on undergraduate courses across the country.
Our staff have worked at local, national and international level with bodies like local councils, the Home Office, Amnesty International and the United Nations.
Core staff on this programme include:
Dr Samuel Singler
Dr Samuel Singler's research covers the field of Border Criminology, focusing on the effects of novel border security technologies on the global criminalisation of migration. His empirical work on the International Organization for Migration's (IOM) capacity-building practices in Nigeria illuminates how and why security technologies diffuse across and through borders, how they shape contemporary ‘crimmigration' policies, and how they are deployed and contested on the ground in post-colonial contexts.

COMPONENT 01: CORE
The Psychosocial Imagination
(30 CREDITS)
This introductory, two-term module foregrounds the ‘psychosocial’ in the BA in Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies. Whilst deeply rooted in a range of theoretical ideas, the module will be selective in its treatment of the psychosocial, and illustrative of further areas of study to come at later points in the degree. 

The module’s main point of emphasis will be on ‘imagination’, in a dual sense. Both how we might imagine the ‘psychosocial’ as a discipline, with its specific forms of knowledge, theoretical frames and domains of application, but also in the sense that psychosocial studies might give weight to forms of imagination and representation in their capacity to link subjective and embodied existence with social life.

COMPONENT 02: CORE
Introduction to Crime, Law and Society
(30 CREDITS)
What are different forms of crime? What is the role of criminal justice? And how effective are penal sanctions? We provide a critical introduction to the problem of, and responses to, crime. You examine the history of criminological ideas, Britain’s criminal justice system, and current debates on crime and control.
