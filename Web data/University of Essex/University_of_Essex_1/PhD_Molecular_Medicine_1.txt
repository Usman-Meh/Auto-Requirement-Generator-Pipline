Life Sciences (School of)
Research in our School of Life Sciences covers a wide spectrum of biology from genes to ecosystems, and this broad-based structure provides opportunities for developing novel ideas and inter-disciplinary projects. We offer supervision in all areas of staff expertise in molecular medicine and our research is at the basic-clinical interface and we employ a range of techniques for studying diseases at the molecular and cellular level. We have current projects on cancer and stem cell biology, viruses and infection, basic and reproductive immunology, translational and clinical proteomics, drug design, and genomics and computational biology. Many projects are in collaboration with the NHS and regional hospitals.
As a research student at Essex, you will work at the heart of our internationally acknowledged, well-resourced and well-connected research community. We offer world-class supervision and training opportunities, and encourage you to engage with other researchers, professionals, practitioners and research users, where possible, for example using the generous funding from Proficio to attend conferences and training courses.
Part-time research study is also available. You can start this degree in October, January or April. An MPhil and MSD are also available.
Why we're great.
We have an international reputation for outstanding teaching and research, with the latter reflected in the large number of publications in high-profile journals.
We are engaged in translational research and have strong links with local and regional hospitals as well as Public Health England.
Collaborate alongside our research groups working on important international and national problems using cutting-edge techniques.
Our expert staff
Within our School of Life Sciences, you will be allocated a supervisor whose role it is to guide you through the different stages of your research degree. In some cases, you may be jointly supervised.
The support provided by your supervisor is a key feature of your research student experience and you will have regular one-to-one meetings to discuss progress on your research. Initially, your supervisor will help you develop your research topic and plan.
Twice a year, you will have a supervisory board meeting, which provides a more formal opportunity to discuss your progress and agree your plans for the next six months.
Your technical and intellectual development will be enhanced by becoming part of a Research Group, and participating in School Seminars.
Specialist facilities
Our School provides a comprehensive range of facilities for molecular medicine research which include:
fully automated laboratories with robotic liquid handling systems and equipment for cell culture, molecular biology and gene editing
high performance computing cluster with 368 CPUs, 5.4 Tb of RAM and 700 Tb of storage for analyses of large biological data sets
advanced bioimaging suite to visualise and process images of biological processes in real time
X-ray crystallography and macromolecular interactions facilities for the biophysical characterisation of proteins and other macromolecules
advanced bioimaging suite to visualise and analyse images of biological processes in real time
a range of facilities for cell and microbial culture
next-generation sequence analysis facilities
A dedicated study room allows all our postgraduate research students to have access to a desk and a computer outside of the research laboratories. This provides a focal point for our postgraduates, facilitating reading and writing as well as good communication and a sense of community.
Your future
Many of our postgraduates continue their scientific research by taking up postdoctoral positions in the UK and overseas. Others have embarked on careers in biomedical laboratories and in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, both in research and development. We support your
career
development by a mentoring scheme and employability events.
Entry requirements
UK entry requirements
You will need a good Masters degree or equivalent, in a related subject.  A well developed research proposal is also essential.

Structure
Course structure
A research degree doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100

Assessment
The aim of undertaking your PhD within our School of Life Sciences is to train you to become independent researchers who can critically assess research work, and who have a comprehensive understanding of at least one area of biology.
Our PhD programme is usually three to four years duration and all our students are initially registered as MPhil students, then transfer to the PhD in the first half of their second year of study if they have made satisfactory progress.
Dissertation
Within our School of Life Sciences, you attend two formal supervisory board meetings each year, where you submit literature reviews and research reports to the Board members. At these meetings, the documents are discussed with you and your progress is assessed.
We encourage PhD students to submit within three years and certainly expect completion of PhDs within a four-year period.
