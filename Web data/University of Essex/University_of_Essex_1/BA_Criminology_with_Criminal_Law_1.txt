Criminologists and lawyers engage with some of the most pressing issues, decisions and dilemmas facing societies today. This course explores the nature of crime, criminal law and criminal justice within wider social contexts.
As a student of criminology and law, you experience a lively, informal environment with many possibilities to pursue your own interests. Our flexible course means that you can study an exciting range of topics including:
Cyber crime
Terrorism and illegal migration
Criminal justice and public policy
Policing
Principles of criminal law
You receive training in criminological research methods including how to design a survey, how to map crime hotspots, conduct interviews and focus groups. You are also introduced to legal research methods.
You're taught by criminologists and academics from the
Department of Sociology and Criminology
and

Study abroad
Your education extends beyond the university campus. We support you in expanding your education through offering the opportunity to spend a year or a term studying abroad at one of our partner universities. The four-year version of our degree allows you to spend the third year abroad or employed on a placement abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the three-year course.
Studying abroad allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.
If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university.
Placement year
You can also undertake a placement year in which you gain relevant work experience within an external business, giving you a competitive edge in the graduate job market and providing you with key contacts within the industry. You will be responsible for finding your placement, but with support and guidance provided by both your department and our
placements team

Our expert staff
Criminology at Essex is taught by an outstanding team including:  Professor Eamonn Carrabine (editor of the British Journal of Criminology),  Professor Pamela Cox (a consultant for the Victims' Commissioner), Professor Pete Fussey (an advisor to the Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner), Dr Kat Hadjimatheou (an advisor to the Home Office on domestic abuse), Prof Anna Sergi (an advisor to Interpol on organised crime) and Dr Sobie Kaker (member of Karachi Urban Lab). But you may already be familiar with our academics before you meet them in lectures.
As well as publishing core texts and bestselling books, our academics often appear on TV and radio.  Recent examples include Professor Mike Roper on The Psychology of War for the BBC World Service and Professor Pam Cox in her BBC TWO series Shopgirls: The True Story of Life Behind the Counter. Others engage with politics and policy making, such as those running our specialist centres for Migration Studies and Criminology.
Core staff on this programme include:
Dr Kat Hadjimatheou
Dr Kat Hadjimatheou's research looks at how new technologies and data are used for policing, criminal justice and security. In 2023 she worked with the College of Policing to draft the new Code of Police Ethics for England and Wales. She is currently working with police across the country and the National Police Chief's Council to help police improve how they share information about serial domestic abuse perpetrators with victims under Clare's Law.
Dr Samuel Singler
Dr Samuel Singler's research covers the field of Border Criminology, focusing on the effects of novel border security technologies on the global criminalisation of migration. His empirical work on the International Organization for Migration's (IOM) capacity-building practices in Nigeria illuminates how and why security technologies diffuse across and through borders, how they shape contemporary â€˜crimmigration' policies, and how they are deployed and contested on the ground in post-colonial contexts.
