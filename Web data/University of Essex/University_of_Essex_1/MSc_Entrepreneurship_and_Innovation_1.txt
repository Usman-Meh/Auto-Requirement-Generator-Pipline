Entrepreneurship and innovation are terms that go hand in hand as entrepreneurs frequently innovate in order to achieve economic prosperity, regional growth and social transformation.
MSc Entrepreneurship and Innovation uses innovative and interactive teaching, such as group working and applied projects, to develop your practical business knowledge and employability skills. We hone your entrepreneurial spirit, so you can have the capabilities and confidence to launch your own venture, manage your family business or introduce innovative ideas to improve performance at existing organisations.
This course explores the entrepreneurial issues and challenges high on the agendas of businesses, governments, policy-makers, researchers, educators and wider communities across the world.
You explore topics including:
economic, sociological, psychological and managerial theories of enterprise creation
theories and practices of entrepreneurship
entrepreneurship skills
strategic innovation management
new venture development
how to prepare a business plan
This course is delivered by
Essex Business School
at our
Southend Campus
. Essex is one of the most entrepreneurial places in the UK and an exciting place to do business. We have more start-up businesses than any other county in the UK, some based right here on our campus. This entrepreneurial spirit, global community and academic expertise come together to inspire innovative thinking.
Guest lectures give you access to practitioners and policymakers, who share real-world experiences to prepare you to tackle the challenges facing entrepreneurs and SMEs today. Instead of a dissertation, you can opt to complete a comprehensive business plan for your new venture or an existing business, allowing you to gain valuable feedback on your ideas from academics and industry practitioners.
You can study this course starting in either October or January. Please note that the January entry point is only available on a full-time basis and cannot be studied part-time.
Why we're great.
Alongside your studies, Essex Startups, our own team of in house startup experts, can help you turn your business idea into a reality.
You'll work with academics investigating truly innovative entrepreneurs, including from a range of marginalised groups.
You can choose to complete a business plan for your own business venture instead of a dissertation.

Components and modules explained

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
