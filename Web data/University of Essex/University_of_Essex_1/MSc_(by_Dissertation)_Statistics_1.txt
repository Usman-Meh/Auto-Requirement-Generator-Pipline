Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science (School of)
Our MSD Statistics is a research degree within our School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science and we have staff members available to act as supervisors across a number of areas within statistics. Possible areas of research include: statistical modelling and smoothing, Bayesian computational statistics, nonparametric statistics, and longitudinal analysis, but interested persons are invited to
get in touch
with our School to discuss potential research areas.
Our staff are strongly committed to research and teaching. They have published several well-regarded text books and are world leaders in their individual specialisms, with their papers appearing in learned journals such as:
Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference, Journal of Nonparametric Statistics, Big Data Analytics
, and
Statistics in Medicine
.
Our School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science is genuinely innovative and student-focused. Our research groups are working on a broad range of collaborative areas tackling real-world issues. Here are a few examples:
Our data scientists carefully consider how not to lie, and how not to get lied to with data. Interpreting data correctly is especially important because much of our data science research is applied directly or indirectly to social policies, including health, care and education.
We do practical research with financial data (for example, assessing the risk of collapse of the UK's banking system) as well as theoretical research in financial instruments such as insurance policies or asset portfolios.
We also research how physical processes develop in time and space. Applications of this range from modelling epilepsy to modelling electronic cables.
Our optimisation experts work out how to do the same job with less resource, or how to do more with the same resource.
Our pure maths group are currently working on two new funded projects entitled “The Calabi problem for smooth Fano threefolds” and “Stability of Brunn-Minkowski inequalities and Minkowski type problems for nonlinear capacity”.
We also do research into mathematical education and use exciting technologies such as electroencephalography or eye tracking to measure exactly what a learner is feeling. Our research aims to encourage the implementation of ‘the four Cs' of modern education, which are critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity.
We also offer an MPhil and a PhD in this subject, and part time study is also available.
Why we're great.
We have a strong track record on knowledge transfer partnerships funded by Innovate UK and ESRC with businesses and governments across the region and beyond.
Our School is ranked 31st for research power in the Research Excellence Framework 2021.
Our School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science has an internationally excellent reputation in areas such as algebraic geometry, group theory, semigroup theory, differential equations, optimisation, probability, applied statistics, bioinformatics and mathematical biology.
Our expert staff
The School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science has an international reputation in all areas of Mathematical Sciences including: statistics, operational research, applied mathematics, pure mathematics, and actuarial science.
We encourage MSD students to meet with their supervisor regularly. While undertaking your research within Mathematical Sciences, joint supervision across other Essex departments and schools is possible. Joint supervision allows you to have a supervisor based in our School and another in a relevant Department or School (such as Life Sciences, or Computer Science and Electronic Engineering).
Specialist facilities
The School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science is based in the University's state-of-the-art STEM Centre. Research students have a dedicated work space and PCs, with access to software such as MATLAB, Gap, SageMath, Python and R.
All University of Essex research students have access to our innovative and unique scheme,
Proficio
. Postgraduate research students are automatically enrolled on Proficio, which provides a variety of training courses, and a fund of up to £1,000 per MSD student for attendance on these courses.
Your future
Studying a research degree in mathematics gives you the opportunity to develop new skills and enhance your CV.
Our graduates have joined organisations like the Met Office, the Ministry of Defence, and companies based in the City of London, others have remained in academia. There is a high demand for those with a numerate background in all sectors of the economy, so our graduates are sought after in the UK and abroad.

Structure
Course structure
A research degree gives you the chance to investigate an area or topic in real depth, and develop transferable research skills. During your time in the School you have opportunities to take part in departmental research seminars, and attend some university modules. You will also meet with your supervisor, typically on a weekly basis.
Within our School, our MSD students are usually encouraged to take our taught module, Research Methods, so you are well equipped with the necessary skills to undertake effective research. You may also attend some other modules on an informal basis.
Our full-time research students have a supervisory board to review their progress every six months (or annually if studying part-time). Typically, the board involves your supervisor and one other academic. The recommendations of this are considered by our Departmental Research Students' Progress Board, which will make decisions on your registration status.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100
