Our BA Criminology (including Foundation Year) could be suitable for you if your academic qualifications do not yet meet our entry requirements for a three-year version of our social sciences courses and you want a programme that improves your skills to support your academic performance.
Open to UK and EU applicants, this four-year course includes a Foundation Year (known as Year Zero) which is delivered by our
Essex Pathways Department
followed by a further three years of study in our
Department of Sociology and Criminology.
During Year Zero you will study on our
Social Sciences Pathway
which will cover topics such as Analysing the Social and Political World, and People and Society. At the end of Year Zero all students who pass the Social Sciences Pathway will have a choice of which course to progress with. As well as BA Criminology students on the Social Sciences Pathway could also study BA Politics or BA Sociology, amongst other courses.
From Year One of BA Criminology you will explore the nature of crime, criminal justice and punishment within wider social contexts. Our flexible course means that you can study an exciting range of topics, from the impact of computer games on crime, to terrorism and migration, to policing and controlling society.
We are a large and friendly department, offering a range and diversity of research interests, with leading international experts in the areas of:
Organised crime, surveillance and counter-terrorism
Environmental harm
Visual criminology
Social history and crime
You'll also receive training in criminological methods – how to design a survey, conduct an interview, and use quantitative analysis from basic statistic to big data – in order to ask the difficult questions.
Our BA Criminology is run by the
Department of Sociology and Criminology
, which is 2nd in UK for research power in sociology (Times Higher Education research power measure, Research Excellence Framework 2021).
Why we're great.
We equip you with the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed studying Criminology at Essex and beyond.
Guarantee your place on your chosen course if you successfully complete your foundation year at Essex.
Small class sizes allow you to work closely with your teachers and classmates.
Our expert staff
Our Essex Pathways Department is a gateway to the University of Essex, helping students without standard entry requirements to grow in confidence, unlock their potential, and nurture their ambitions so they can progress in academic study.
All lecturing staff in the Department of Sociology and Criminology are actively researching at the cutting edge of their respective disciplines and bring the very latest research findings into the classroom. All are prominent writers and the criminology team collectively authored the best-selling criminology textbook, ‘Criminology: A Sociological Introduction', used on undergraduate courses across the country.
Our staff have worked at local, national and international level with bodies like local councils, the Home Office, Amnesty International and the United Nations.
Core staff on this programme include:
Dr Anna Di Ronco
Dr Anna Di Ronco is Director of our Centre for Criminology and a member of our Human Rights Centre and our Centre for Migration Studies. Anna's research critically addresses policies and policing practices that penalise people and exclude them from the urban space. As part of this, Anna works with environmental activists to expose their criminalisation and defend their right to protest.
Professor Anna Sergi
Professor Anna Sergi researches how organised crime groups form and how they influence everyday life, from trade to politics. She explores ways of identifying and countering the dangers of mafia infiltration, focusing specifically on the ‘ndrangheta, one of the world's most extensive and powerful criminal organizations.
Professor Pete Fussey
Professor Pete Fussey works on the human rights impact of AI and other emerging technologies in policing and security contexts. His research focuses on surveillance, digital sociology, algorithmic justice, human rights, intelligence oversight, and technology and policing. His recent work on
facial recognition technology
has informed policy at the UN and EU levels, been transposed into national policy, was discussed in parliament and featured in over 300 news stories including the front pages of The Guardian and FT.
Professor Eamonn Carrabine
Professor Eamonn Carrabine has published widely in criminology and sociology. He is most well-known for his award winning research on visual criminology, and he is currently writing a series of books on the ‘iconography of punishment'. The first of which concentrates on representations of punishment in medieval and renaissance worlds, indicating that the relationships between the history of art and history of punishment are closer and stranger than we might think. He currently serves as the Editor-in-Chief on the British Journal of Criminology, and between 2015 to 2019 Michele Brown (University of Tennessee) and Eamonn co-edited the journal Crime, Media, Culture.

Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options

Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Understanding People and Society
(30 CREDITS)
The module aims to establish a theoretical foundation for students pursuing degrees in Social Science through the introduction of some key theories and concepts associated with the fields of Sociology, Criminology and Psychoanalysis and Psychosocial studies.

As such the Autumn Term focuses on criminological theory and its application to contemporary society whilst also encouraging the development of a Sociological Imagination through debating current social issues based on the work of key social theorists. In Spring term building upon the learning in Autumn Term, students will use the lens of psychoanalysis to explore how people interact within society. They will consider the way individuals affect one another and how  institutions affect the people who work in them and vice versa. Throughout the module, expert guest speakers are periodically invited to contribute to lectures and seminars.

Exceptionally it can be necessary to make changes, for example to courses, facilities or fees. Examples of such reasons might include, but are not limited to: strikes, other industrial action, staff illness, severe weather, fire, civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist attack or threat of terrorist attack (whether declared or not), natural disaster, restrictions imposed by government or public authorities, epidemic or pandemic disease, failure of public utilities or transport systems or the withdrawal/reduction of funding. Changes to courses may for example consist of variations to the content and method of delivery of programmes, courses and other services, to discontinue programmes, courses and other services and to merge or combine programmes or courses. The University will endeavour to keep such changes to a minimum, and will also keep students informed appropriately by updating our
programme specifications
. The University would inform and engage with you if your course was to be discontinued, and would provide you with options, where appropriate, in line with our Compensation and Refund Policy.
The full Procedures, Rules and Regulations of the University governing how it operates are set out in the Charter, Statutes and
Ordinances and in the University Regulations, Policy and Procedures.
