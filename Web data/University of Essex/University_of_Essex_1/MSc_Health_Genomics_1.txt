Our MSc Health Genomics course will train you to analyse genomic data in connection with health and disease. You will explore how genome sequences are analysed and you will receive hands-on experience in data analysis. You will also study gene and genome technologies, as well as have the opportunity to develop your professional skills.
Genome sequencing is revolutionising the field of medicine. The ability to sequence and analyse the genome of individuals in a fast and inexpensive manner, provides an unprecedented level of genetic information associated to health and disease. The data processing of such levels of information is challenging, and requires specialised skills in genomics, health and data analysis.
MSc Health Genomics will cover the following topics, amongst others:
Gene technologies and general genomics
Bioinformatics and computational biology
Data analysis and computing programming
State-of-the-art genome-wide analysis techniques
Statistical analysis of biomedical data

English language requirements
If English is not your first language, we require IELTS 6.5 overall with a minimum  score of 5.5 in all components.
If you do not meet our IELTS requirements then you may be able to complete a
pre-sessional English
pathway
that enables you to start your course without retaking IELTS.
Additional Notes
The University uses academic selection criteria to determine an applicant’s ability to
successfully complete a course at the University of Essex. Where appropriate, we may ask
for specific information relating to previous modules studied or work experience.
Structure
Course structure
All of the modules listed below provide an example of what is on offer from the current academic year. Our Programme Specification provides further details of the course structure for the current academic year.
Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The course content is therefore reviewed on an annual basis to ensure our courses remain up-to-date so modules listed are subject to change.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100
4
FY
The department or school the module will be taught by.
In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History.
The module number.
The
UK academic level
of the module.
A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.
A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.
A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification.

COMPONENT 01: CORE
Research Project - Health Genomics
(60 CREDITS)
Your Research Project is the largest piece of work that you will complete during the course and contributes 90 credits (33%) of your final marks. You should find this to be both stimulating and of particular importance for your future career, because it will provide you with the opportunity to analyse a system in some depth and perform a coherent set of experiments allowing you to further develop your skills in experimental design, problem solving and the analysis and interpretation of data.

COMPONENT 02: CORE
Advanced Research Skills
(30 CREDITS)
This module provides you with the research methods and analytical skills that are necessary to carry out a research project on a specific topic.
View Advanced Research Skills on our Module Directory
COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY
Analysis of Genomic Data
(30 CREDITS)
The module aims to provide solid training in data handling and analysis with R, as well as in techniques to retrieve, store and access genomics data. You will learn a wide range of computational techniques to handle and analyse genomic data of relevance in health and disease.

COMPONENT 04: COMPULSORY
Gene Technology and Synthetic Biology
(30 CREDITS)
The development of techniques to manipulate and analyse nucleic acids has revolutionised the study of biology, and provided the key driver for massive expansion in biotechnology. You explore the major tools used in gene technology and gain a practical understanding of how they are used, as well as the molecular techniques that can be used to explore biological questions. Gain an understanding of the impact of gene technology and synthetic biology and explore the applications of genome scale methods for studying gene expression in biotechnology and molecular medicine.

COMPONENT 05: COMPULSORY
Genomics
(15 CREDITS)
The sequencing of the human genome is one of the biggest achievements of this century.  Nowadays, genomics is leading to major advances in biotechnology and molecular medicine, such as enhanced diagnostic tools, better vaccines, improved treatments for disease, and better detection of pollutants. In this module, you gain an understanding of current genomics approaches, including genome sequencing and comparative genomics. You also learn how to study your own genomic data, using state-of-the-art computational resources.

Teaching
We teach using a combination of lectures, laboratory practical's, tutorials, seminars, fieldwork, independent reading and research projects. Postgraduate Taught students in the School of Life Sciences typically attend about 10 hours of workshops, lectures, seminars and practicals each week.
Assessment
Our modules are assessed by a combination of exams, essays, presentations and written reviews.
Dissertation
An important component of the course is a research project under the supervision of one of our internationally recognised investigators. Your research project will immerse you in a research environment, allowing you to conduct your research alongside our expert academics and PhD students in shared labs.
