Based in:
Sociology and Criminology
Criminology programmes are hosted within our
Department of Sociology and Criminology
. We offer supervision that covers a wide range of topics and we take a global approach to the subject, with particular expertise in diverse regional settings. You will work with a supervisor whose role is to guide you through the different stages of your research degree. In some cases, you may have joint supervision by two members of our staff and where appropriate with staff from other departments.
The Criminology group is the largest in the Department, with 11 full time members of staff who have particular research strengths in:
crime and the media
drug use and markets
women, crime and criminal justice
green criminology and crimes against the environment
organised crime
prisons and rehabilitation
sexual labour, regulation and human rights
histories of crime, punishment and victimisation
security
surveillance
terrorism and counter-terrorism
Reflecting this, the Department is home to the
Centre for Criminology
, as well as three other research centres: the Centre for Research in Economic Sociology and Innovation (CRESI), the Migration Research Centre, and the Centre for Intimate and Sexual Citizenship (CISC). The Centre for Criminology runs seminars throughout the year, both by itself and in collaboration with others such as the Human Rights Centre. It also works with others on local, regional and national conferences and events.
Why we're great.
We pioneered sociologically informed approaches to criminology — Essex is where it all started
Our staff have worked with bodies including the Home Office, Amnesty International and the United Nations
We’re ranked 73rd globally and top 15 in the UK for sociology in the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2024
Our expert staff
The support provided by your supervisor is a key feature of your research student experience and you will have regular one-to-one meetings to discuss progress on your research. Initially, your supervisor will help you develop your research topic and plan. Members of the team are:
Professor Eamonn Carrabine
Professor Pam Cox
Dr Alexandra Cox
Dr Isabel Crowhurst
Dr Anna Di Ronco
Professor Pete Fussey
Dr Johanna Römer
Dr Anna Sergi
Professor Nigel South
Dr Darren Thiel
Professor Jackie Turton
Specialist facilities
At Essex, our library holdings in criminology and sociology are very strong – criminology and the sociology of deviance have been taught here by academics such as Stanley Cohen and Ken Plummer since the early 1970s.
Within our Department of Sociology and Criminology, we have an ever-increasing range of open-access computing facilities available for your use and, to further assist you with your research, we have bibliographic and qualitative analysis packages available on some of these machines.
We have our own Student Resource Centre which provides a range of support for all our sociology students, including help with study skills.
Your future
Many of our postgraduates go on to successful academic careers, both in the UK and overseas. Others have established careers in non-governmental organisations, local authorities, specialist think tanks, government departments, charities, media production, and market research.
Our University is strong across the social sciences so, by studying with us, you gain the opportunity to work with and be taught by world-class scholars. We have strong interdisciplinary links which mean your studies can be informed by a variety of perspectives.

Structure
Course structure
A research degree doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100
4
FY
The department or school the module will be taught by.
In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History.
The module number.
The
UK academic level
of the module.
A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.

Assessment
Within our Department of Sociology and Criminology, the PhD is a structured three-year programme of advanced study and research. We also offer an M. Phil, which is a two year programme. If you wish to undertake a PhD but are not sufficiently qualified, you may be offered our MA/MSc and PhD (four-year programme), where progression to your PhD is conditional on successful completion of your MA/MSc.
We therefore offer two routes to a PhD. If you have a strong background in sociology, and/or related areas a well-formulated research proposal, you may be admitted directly to do supervised research and complete your PhD. Alternatively, we offer an Integrated PhD, where you follow one of our pathways in your first year, which provides you with Masters-level training, then undertake three years of PhD research.
Dissertation
Your thesis should be no longer than 50,000 words. We expect our MPhil students to complete their MPhil within four years of entering, so you will be regularly monitored through supervisory and other meetings to ensure that you complete your MPhil on time.
You will meet your supervisor regularly and twice a year, you will have a Supervisory Board meeting, which provides a formal opportunity to discuss your progress and agree your immediate and future plans.
