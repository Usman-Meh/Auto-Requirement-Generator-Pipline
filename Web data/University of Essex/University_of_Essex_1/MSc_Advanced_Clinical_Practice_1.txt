We understand that you may not have the time to do a full-time degree, so our CPD pathways allow you to study flexibly, in the way that best suits you. The structure, mode of delivery and level of support allow you to progress towards a qualification at Masters level.  We also offer an
apprenticeship pathway at Masters level
.
Our MSc Advanced Clinical Practice is designed for health care professionals in primary, secondary and tertiary settings who wish to advance their knowledge-base and clinical skills. Irrespective of your clinical speciality, you will become actively involved in the advancement of practice which will be recognised within the degree award.
Advanced Clinical Practice is an evolving process in which new skills are continuously being developed and refined in response to the needs of clients. The NHS Plan seeks to challenge traditional role boundaries and recognises that professionals of all clinical disciplines have the potential to develop advanced clinical skills to support the client from referral to discharge.
By the end of your time with us you will be able to:
Pioneer new roles which are responsive to changing health needs
Act in a leadership role for other team members and other professionals in the development of their practice
Demonstrate expert judgement in the assessment and management of specific client groups
Demonstrate a critical awareness of factors that influence service provision and use innovative problem solving skills to effect best use of resources
The School of Health and Social Care is proud to work closely with our Service User Reference Group (SURG).  SURG is made up of service users, carers, and volunteers who generously share their first-hand experiences of health and social care.  We work collaboratively with SURG to design our courses to ensure that we truly are putting the needs of patients and clients at the heart of what we do.  SURG members support the delivery of our teaching sessions and research activity, which means you'll benefit from an insight into their lived experiences of living with a diagnosis, health condition, or circumstance.  You'll find that not only does your clinical knowledge expand, but your empathy, compassion and ability to advocate develops also.
Professional, statutory and regulatory bodies
We are committed to embedding the
NHS Constitution Values
(which are strongly reflected in our University values) into everything we do. They define the behaviours and expectations of all our staff and students underpinning the work we do in the university, clinical arena and other workplaces.
We understand that not all of our students and staff are employed within the NHS but these values uphold the underlying principles of excellent care as a standard, and as such we expect that anyone who cares for others will aspire to uphold these values.
For us, involving not only our students, but service users, experts by experience, carers and NHS/non NHS professionals in the creation and delivery of all programmes is vital.
Professional accreditation
Accredited by the Centre of Advancing Practice.
Why we're great.
Develop your knowledge base and clinical skills with a flexible, part-time CPD pathway
Challenge traditional boundaries – gain the skills and recognition in advancing clinical practice
Work alongside experts in your field and benefit from their wide range of clinical and academic experience
Our expert staff

Athena Swan
Silver Award for gender equality.  This award recognises initiatives we have in place such as our mentorship system, our additional promotion of flexible work and study options, and our work to recognise the barriers to opportunity for BAME and LGBT members of our community.

Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100

There is recognition that effective health practitioners are skilled clinicians who enhance the patient experience by bridging gaps in service provision.

This programme has been designed for experienced nurses and allied health professionals working in clinical settings.
