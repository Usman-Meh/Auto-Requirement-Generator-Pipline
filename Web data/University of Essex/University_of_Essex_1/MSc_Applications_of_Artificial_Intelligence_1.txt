in order to study at Essex. It is one of a kind and globally recognised for raising Leaders that would impact positive change in their fields, local communities and in the world at large. Without the scholarship I probably would never have had the opportunity to study in the UK. The scholarship truly has had a profound impact on my life and will continue to do so in the future. Receiving this scholarship feels like being granted a global platform to showcase my potential and make a meaningful impact. I am not only empowered, but also connected with a dynamic community of leaders and talented individuals who share a common goal of driving positive change. I am proud to say that the Chevening Scholarship is not just a financial scholarship, but also an entryway to a powerful network of change-makers."

Structure
Course structure
We offer a flexible course structure with a mixture of core/compulsory modules, and optional modules chosen from lists.
Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The course content is therefore reviewed on an annual basis to ensure our courses remain up-to-date so modules listed are subject to change.
The example structure below is representative of this course if taken full-time. If you choose to study part-time, the modules will be split across two years.
Please note that if you are studying full-time (either starting in October or January) there is no second year; you will develop your dissertation throughout the course of your single year.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained

You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:

COMPONENT 01: COMPULSORY
Professional Practice and Research Methodology
(15 CREDITS)
This module aims to prepare students for conducting an independent research project leading to a dissertation and to provide them with an appreciation of research and business skills related to their professional career. As a precursor to their project students, individually select an area of Computer Science, or Electronic Engineering, or Computational Finance and perform the necessary background research to define a topic and prepare a project proposal under the  guidance of a supervisor. The module guides them by a) introducing common research methods b) creating an understanding of basic statistics for describing and making conclusions from data c) helping to write a strong proposal including learning how to perform literature search and evaluation and d) giving an in-depth view into the business enterprise, financial and management accounting and investment appraisal.

COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY
An Approachable Introduction to Programming
(15 CREDITS)
This module will help you develop your coding skills, and assumes you have no prior coding skills. The language used will be âPythonâ, which is well known as an introductory programming language, with the ability to learn starting with a simple single line of code approach. As your coding skills develop, you will be able to review and debug simple code, as a route to developing your own code, through the assembling of coding blocks. You will have the opportunity to experience code relevant to your own course, and to develop code that is useful within your degree context.

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY
Information Retrieval
(15 CREDITS)
Search engines have become the first entry point into a world of knowledge and they form an essential part of many modern computer applications. While much of the underlying principles have been developed over decades, the landscape of search engine technology has changed dramatically in recent years to deal with data sources magnitudes larger than ever before (the rise of 'big data'). As a result of this, new paradigms for storing, indexing and accessing information have emerged. This module will provide the essential foundation of information retrieval and equip students with solid, applicable knowledge of state-of-the-art search technology.

COMPONENT 05: COMPULSORY
Group Project
(15 CREDITS)
Teamwork skills are essential for employability.  The aim of this module is to provide students with the opportunity to apply their specialised knowledge to a realistic problem and gain practical experience of the processes involved in the team-based production of software. Wherever possible, teams are organised on the basis of shared interest, and the problem is designed to exercise their understanding of their area of specialised study. Starting from an outline description of a realistic problem, each team is required to develop a fully implemented software solution using appropriate engineering and project management techniques.

COMPONENT 06: COMPULSORY
Artificial intelligence and machine learning with applications
(15 CREDITS)
This module introduces Artificial Intelligence (AI), the science of making computers and machines display intelligent behaviour. This multidisciplinary activity draws from computer sciences, mathematics and statistics, and also elements of philosophy, logic and even psychology. Today, AI is ubiquitous in society, from self-driving cars to spam filters and finance trading to video games. The increasing dependence on AI will reshape society and economy. Understanding AI principles, applications, and limitations is important for all students, regardless of their background, and this module assumes no prior knowledge. This module provides both theoretical and practical techniques, covering AI theory and fundamentals of machine learning models, as well as their implementation and applications.
