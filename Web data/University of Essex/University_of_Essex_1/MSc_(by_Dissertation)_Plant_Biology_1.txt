Life Sciences (School of)
Research in our School of Life Sciences covers a wide spectrum of biology from genes to ecosystems, and this broad-based structure provides opportunities for developing novel ideas and inter-disciplinary projects. Our staff have expertise in photosynthesis, plant productivity, plant ecophysiology and cell signalling and can offer supervision of projects in these areas. We use a variety of approaches to identify key genes and processes that determine productivity in plants in constantly changing environmental conditions.
As a research student at Essex, you will work at the heart of our internationally acknowledged, well-resourced and well-connected research community. We offer world-class supervision and training opportunities, and encourage you to engage with other researchers, professionals, practitioners and research users, where possible, for example using the generous funding from Proficio to attend conferences and training courses.
A PhD and MPhil are also available. Both full- and part-time study can be supported, and you can start this course in either January, April or October.
Why we're great.
You will work within our Plant Productivity Group which has an international reputation for outstanding research.
Our Group has an extensive network of national and international collaborations through projects funded by the BBSRC, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, EU, Leverhulme Trust, Innovate UK and industry.
We have strong links with industry working on a number of collaborative projects with companies such as Bayer and Syngenta.
Our expert staff
Within our School of Life Sciences, you will be allocated a supervisor whose role it is to guide you through the different stages of your research degree. In some cases, you may be jointly supervised.
The support provided by your supervisor is a key feature of your research student experience and you will have regular one-to-one meetings to discuss progress on your research. Initially, your supervisor will help you develop your research topic and plan.
Twice a year, you will have a supervisory board meeting, which provides a more formal opportunity to discuss your progress and agree your plans for the next six months.
Your technical and intellectual development will be enhanced by becoming part of a Research Group, and participating in School Seminars.
Specialist facilities
Our School of Life Sciences is fully equipped to perform cutting edge plant physiology and phenotyping research using a combination of conventional and custom designed apparatus including:
facilities for chlorophyll fluorescence and thermal imaging of whole plants and cells
a plant phenotyping platform that houses a novel dynamic lighting system
equipment for infra-red gas exchange analysis including whole plant chambers for Arabidopsis
computer-controlled glasshouse and controlled environment facilities
A dedicated study room allows all our postgraduate research students to have access to a desk and a computer outside of the research laboratories. This provides a focal point for our postgraduates, facilitating reading and writing as well as good communication and a sense of community.
Your future
Many of our postgraduates continue their scientific research by taking up postdoctoral positions in the UK and overseas. Others go on to work with industry or governmental and non-governmental organisations. We support your
career
development by a mentoring scheme and employability events.
Entry requirements
UK entry requirements
You will need a good honours degree or a Masters degree, or equivalent, in a related subject.  A well-developed research proposal is also essential.
You will normally be required to attend an interview/Skype interview for acceptance, and acceptance is subject to research expertise in the department.
International & EU entry requirements
We accept a wide range of qualifications from applicants studying in the EU and other countries. Get in touch with any questions you may have about the qualifications we accept. Remember to tell us about the qualifications you have already completed or are currently taking.

Structure
Course structure
A research degree doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100

The department or school the module will be taught by.
In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History.

The
UK academic level
of the module.
A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.
A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.
A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification.

Assessment
The aim of undertaking your MSD within our School of Life Sciences is to train independent researchers who can critically assess other research work, and have a comprehensive knowledge of at least one area of biology.
An MSD involves a minimum of one year of full-time research or two years part time followed by production of a dissertation. Students enrolled on an MSD programme can upgrade to an MPhil or PhD subject to satisfactory progress.
Dissertation
Within our School of Life Sciences, you must attend two formal supervisory board meetings each year where you submit literature reviews and research reports to the Board members prior to the meeting. At these meetings, such documents are discussed with you and your progress is assessed.
Your MSD thesis is generally completed within one to two years and has a maximum length of 30,000 words.
Fees and funding
Home/UK fee
£4,786 per year
International fee
£21,500 per year
Fees will increase for each academic year of study.
