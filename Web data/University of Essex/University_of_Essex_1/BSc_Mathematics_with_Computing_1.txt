Mathematics and computing are intertwined, and affect people's lives in ways you might not expect. Maths is the language that underpins the modern world.
Our BSc Mathematics with Computing course is mathematical at heart, but is backed up with training in programming and algorithms. You'll receive a good grounding in a broad range of subjects and have the flexibility to choose options according to your interests in both our School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science and our School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering. This allows you to tailor your degree to your chosen specialism or preferred career path.
At Essex we help you develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills that will start to prepare you to succeed in a wide range of careers involving mathematics and computing. You can build a sound set of skills spanning both disciplines including rigorous problem-solving skills.
For example, in mathematics you will learn to analyse very large datasets as well as discover deep insights into complex systems. This is complemented by computational modules that give you will the ability to see a computer system from specification through design, testing and documentation to implementation, and experience of writing technical descriptions and reports.
Professional accreditation
This programme will meet the educational requirements of the Chartered Mathematician designation, awarded by the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications, when it is followed by subsequent training and experience in employment to obtain equivalent competences to those specified by the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) for taught masters degrees.
Why we're great.
86% of Essex graduates are in employment or further study (Graduate Outcomes 2024).
We are continually broadening the array of expertise in our School, giving you a wide range of options and letting you tailor your degree to your interests.
We’re ranked 25th in UK for mathematics (The Guardian University Guide 2025).
Study abroad
Your education extends beyond the university campus. We support you in expanding your education through offering the opportunity to spend a year or a term studying abroad at one of our partner universities. The four-year version of our degree allows you to spend the third year abroad or employed on a placement abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the three-year course.
Studying abroad allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.
If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university
Placement year
Alternatively, you can spend your third year with an external organisation, learning about a particular sector, company or job role, applying your academic knowledge in a practical working environment, and receiving inspiration for future career pathways. You will be responsible for finding your placement, but with support and guidance provided by both your department and the placements team.
If you complete a placement year you'll only pay 20% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year.

Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
