The details
Course:
Accounting and Finance
Start date:
January 2025
Study mode:
Full-time
Duration:
3 - 4 years
Location:
Colchester Campus
Based in:
Essex Business School
This research programme gives you the opportunity to undertake advanced empirical research in the fields of accounting and finance. You will gain in-depth knowledge of the research methods used in capital market analysis and will explore areas high on the agenda of financial institutions.
You may choose to explore areas such as:
banking and financial institutions
mergers and takeovers
the role of financial analysts
shareholder activism
You can follow a  'three paper' thesis, where you produce three research articles, framed by an introduction and conclusion. Alternatively, you may opt to follow a traditional thesis approach, writing a complete and systematic account of your research in a dissertation. Your supervisors support you to submit your work to conferences and for publication in international journals, so you can begin to build you international research portfolio well before graduation.
You study at
Essex Business School
(EBS), world-renowned for high-quality empirical research in accounting, finance and related disciplines. We are the largest department at the University of Essex, giving you the opportunity to work alongside expert
academics
with a diverse range of research interests and viewpoints on financial practice and policy.
Our accounting group has an excellent reputation for research on governance, auditing practices in developing countries and the impact of accounting practices in a globalised world. We explore alternative aspects of accounting through a social science lens and champion responsibility and ethics in business. For example,
Emeritus Professor Prem Sikka
's criticisms of corporation tax avoidance can often be found in the national and international media.
We are also home to one of the largest and most respected finance groups in the UK. Our work has been cited in the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve.
You benefit from insight from our many accounting and finance research centres:
Essex Accounting Centre
Essex Finance Centre
BAFA Accounting and Finance in Emerging Economies
Essex Centre for Macro and Financial Econometrics
They organise seminars throughout the year where you have access to the latest academic thinking and the opportunity to network with colleagues and visiting scholars from across the world.
PhD Accounting and Finance can be studied on a full-time or part-time basis and we also offer an Mphil and a Masters by dissertation in this subject.
You may also be eligible for a
PhD scholarship.
Why we're great.
We’re in the top 200 globally for accounting and finance in the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2024.
We have strong links with professional accounting bodies, such as ACCA, ICAEW and CIMA
Our doctoral students join us from more than 40 different nationalities
Our expert staff
At Essex Business School, you benefit from world-class supervision and research training conducted by our senior
academic staff
such as
Dr Pawan Adhikari
. Pawan is a Senior Lecturer in Accounting. His expertise lies within public sector accounting, and his contemporary research follows two distinct directions: a contribution to accounting theory and promoting impact research in emerging economies. His impact research has highlighted the issues that emerging economies are facing while improving their accounting/accountability practices and is widely used in policymaking. He serves as an Associate Editor of the Journal of Public Budgeting, Accounting and Financial Management and in 2019, he was awarded the best postgraduate supervisor at the faculty level.
Our department boasts eight
research
centres across our two campuses.
Dr Louise Nash
and Director of Postgraduate Research at Essex Business School oversees and leads the provision of our graduate research programmes and ensures that we create an environment where our doctoral students can flourish as researchers in a thriving and mutually supportive PhD community.
Louise is a lecturer in Management and Marketing and completed her PhD Management at Essex. She has extensive management and marketing experience which has influenced her research interests – these focus on interpretative, qualitative studies of the lived experience of work, including: the spatial and temporal rhythms of everyday life; the culture, aesthetics and symbolism of organisational life; gender in the workplace and exploring and developing sensory and embodied methods for researching organisations.
You work with two supervisors during your studies. They provide guidance and support to help you achieve your individual research goals, develop your research topic and create a personalised training plan. You meet with your supervisors at least once a month and are usually required to submit work in advance for feedback. Twice a year, you have a supervisory board meeting to discuss your progress and agree your plans for the next six months.
As well as supporting you to complete your thesis, your supervisors can help you to plan your career development. Our academics often co-author publications with doctoral students and can help you to develop the transferable skills needed for the jobs market.

Structure
Course structure
A research degree doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100

Assessment
You begin your studies by meeting with your supervisors and undertaking an intensive induction programme. You attend advanced research methods training and undertake compulsory modules tailored to your individual research needs.
Throughout your PhD, you have regular meetings with your supervisors. You are often asked to write up your ideas or reading notes to help establish good writing practices. By the end of your first year of research, you should have a solid understanding of the key debates in your field and have defined your research questions, outlining your original contribution to knowledge. Our finance students are also expected to have made substantial progress on their first research paper. Those studying via the integrated PhD route (or 1+3) will have completed an additional year to obtain a Masters before beginning their research.
In your second year, you are likely to finalise the design of your own research project and either collect primary data, or access and analyse large scale datasets. You may also make progress on your second research paper. You receive regular feedback on your ideas and findings from your supervisors and are encouraged to develop your own research ideas independently during this year. If you are undertaking fieldwork in another location, your supervisors will still be in touch via email or Skype.
In your final year, you continue to analyse your own research data and further refine your original contribution to knowledge. You will collate your work into a approximately 50-80k words thesis. Our finance students are also expected to make substantial progress on their third research paper.
You may attend a number of conferences in your final year to test out your research findings and thesis on an international stage. Your attendance may be funded by Essex Business School. As well as advising on how to prepare your thesis for examination, your supervisors can advise on future career plans in academia or industry.
Dissertation
Creating a 50-80k word thesis is a significant task. To help you finalise your PhD and produce high quality doctoral research, we have a number of support mechanisms.
You undertake a progress board every six months, where you, your supervisors and an independent chair mark your progress and set objectives for the next period. You are also encouraged to take part in peer group debates and discussions.
Our full-time doctorates are 36 month programmes. At the end of this time, you may be allowed up to 12 months to finish writing up your PhD.
Once you have submitted your thesis, you will be asked to attend a Viva Voce examination with examiners from within and outside of the University.  A viva voce examination usually takes place within three months of submission of thesis.
Fees and funding
Home/UK fee
£4,786 per year
International fee
£18,750 per year
Fees will increase for each academic year of study.
