Actuarial science teaches you the art of turning risks into opportunities. Actuaries provide assessments of financial security systems, with a focus on their complexity, their mathematics, and their mechanisms. You benefit from an excellent starting salary, with graduates earning upwards of £30,000 on average.
Our BSc Actuarial Science course covers the syllabus of many core subjects of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. Depending on your choice of optional modules, and upon sufficient attainment, this can lead to exemptions from the professional exams CS1, CS2, CM1, CM2, CB1 and CB2. More generally, our course features an attractive blend of solid mathematics, an understanding of real-world financial issues, optimisation, experimental design and computing skills which provide you with core skills for entering the world of actuaries and data scientists.
Study topics including:
Mathematical finance
Financial reporting
Contingencies, risk management and survival analysis
Mathematical, statistical and probabilistic techniques
Programming and computation in languages such as Matlab and R
Professional actuaries in the insurance industry, including influential businesses AXA and Buck Consultants, contribute to our employability module and also host students at their offices to show them typical challenges that actuaries face.
As part of our
School of Mathematics, Statistics and Actuarial Science
, you're a member of an inclusive and approachable research community which allows you to explore topics in pure, high-level mathematics and applied mathematics.
Professional accreditation
Accredited by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries for the purpose of exemption from some professional examinations.
This programme will meet the educational requirements of the Chartered Mathematician designation, awarded by the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications, when it is followed by subsequent training and experience in employment to obtain equivalent competences to those specified by the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) for taught masters degrees.
Why we're great.
We’re ranked 25th in UK for mathematics (The Guardian University Guide 2025).
We are continually broadening the array of expertise in our School, giving you a wide range of options and letting you tailor your degree to your interests.
You have access to our excellent dedicated computing facilities that provide real-world experience.
Study abroad
Your education extends beyond the university campus. We support you in expanding your education through offering the opportunity to spend a year or a term studying abroad at one of our partner universities. The four-year version of our degree allows you to spend the third year abroad or employed on a placement abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the three-year course.
Studying abroad allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.
If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university
Placement year
Alternatively, you can spend your third year on a placement year with an external organisation, where you learn about a particular sector, company or job role, apply your academic knowledge in a practical working environment, and receive inspiration for future career pathways. You will be responsible for finding your placement, but with support and guidance provided by both your department and the placements team.
If you complete a placement year you'll only pay 20% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year.

We expect our graduates of BSc Actuarial Science to become actuaries in a range of industries. It is predicted by the US Department of Labor that the employment of actuaries is expected to grow faster than any other occupation, making it a great prospect for a graduate job.
Aside from a rewarding career as an actuary, clear thinkers are required in every profession, so the successful mathematician has an extensive choice of potential careers.
The Council for Mathematical Sciences
offers further information on careers in mathematics.
We also work with our University's
Student Development Team
to help you find out about further work experience, internships, placements, and voluntary opportunities.
“Since graduating I have worked as a Trainee Actuary for a London brokerage, then took a year off to learn to code, and now I am working as an Actuarial Systems Analyst at Pacific Life Re. I help design actuarial models as well as working on tools for the actuarial systems team. My Essex degree definitely helped shape my career choices - and the maths is pretty useful!”

Our Colchester Campus Offer Holder Days run from February to May 2024 on various Wednesdays and Saturdays, and our Southend Campus events run in April and May. These events provide the opportunity to meet your department, tour our campus and accommodation, and chat to current students. To support your attendance, we are offering a travel bursary, allowing you to claim up to £150 as reimbursement for travel expenses. For further information about Offer Holder Days, including terms and conditions and eligibility criteria for our travel bursary, please visit our
webpage.
If you are an overseas offer-holder, you will be invited to attend one of our virtual events. However, you are more than welcome to join us at one of our in-person Offer Holder Days if you are able to - we will let you know in your invite email how you can do this.

The University makes every effort to ensure that this information on its programme specification is accurate and up-to-date. Exceptionally it can be necessary to make changes, for example to courses, facilities or fees. Examples of such reasons might include, but are not limited to: strikes, other industrial action, staff illness, severe weather, fire, civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist attack or threat of terrorist attack (whether declared or not), natural disaster, restrictions imposed by government or public authorities, epidemic or pandemic disease, failure of public utilities or transport systems or the withdrawal/reduction of funding. Changes to courses may for example consist of variations to the content and method of delivery of programmes, courses and other services, to discontinue programmes, courses and other services and to merge or combine programmes or courses. The University will endeavour to keep such changes to a minimum, and will also keep students informed appropriately by updating our
programme specifications
. The University would inform and engage with you if your course was to be discontinued, and would provide you with options, where appropriate, in line with our Compensation and Refund Policy.
The full Procedures, Rules and Regulations of the University governing how it operates are set out in the Charter, Statutes and
Ordinances and in the University Regulations, Policy and Procedures.
