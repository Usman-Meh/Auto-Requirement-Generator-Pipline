The details
Course:
Art History and Theory
Start date:
October 2025
Study mode:
Full-time
Duration:
2 - 3 years
Location:
Colchester Campus
Based in:
Philosophical, Historical, and Interdisciplinary Studies (School of)
For our MPhil in Art History and Theory, we offer supervision across a range of fields and 
have a long tradition of postgraduate training in all the major areas of European art and 
architecture from 1300 to the present, and in the art and architecture of Latin America and 
the United States.  Essex Art History features a dynamic group of art historians 
investigating the production and reception of images and built environments, across cultures 
and media from the early modern period to the present. While we adopt a diverse range of 
approaches in our writing and teaching, our work demonstrates a commitment to three key ideas:
The social and political implications of art, architecture, and visual culture
All forms of visual culture – from paintings to building interiors, from medical imagery to 
tattoos – emerge from and contribute to the mediation of social and political forces. Scholars 
at Essex investigate the role of art, architecture, and other forms of visual culture in the 
assertion, negotiation, and contestation of power in relation to a variety of topics. These 
include the planning of tyrants' cities in the Italian Renaissance; the entanglement of the 
historical avant-garde with the politics of Fascism; and the production of objects by contemporary 
activists in pursuit of social change. Throughout our work, we emphasise issues of autonomy, 
agency, dissent, and the contestation of the public realm.
Space, place, and locale
Art historians at Essex are strongly concerned with the conceptualisation, production, 
experience, and representation of spaces and places. We investigate topics that include 
the ideologies that drive urban change; architectural metaphors in software design; the 
fusion of real and imaginary places in religious paintings; the design of exhibition spaces 
and the implications of curatorial practice; and the varied locales and landscapes of the 
county of Essex itself.
Art produced beyond its historic institutions
We are committed to bringing the approaches of art history into contact with other 
disciplines and discourses in order to interrogate objects of our shared visual and 
material culture, including body art, wax casts, activist placards, and Fascist floor 
mosaics. Our transdisciplinary approach facilitates critical engagement with an array 
of artworks and visual culture that stand both within and beyond the traditional canons 
of art history.
Please note: part-time research study is also available, and we also offer a PhD and a Masters by Dissertation in this subject.
Why we're great.
We have long been recognised for our expertise across a wide range of areas in the history and theory of art, including the Renaissance, nineteenth-century European art, modern and contemporary art, as well as curating and art from Latin America.
We are 3rd in the UK for research outputs in art history (Grade Point Average, REF2021).
During the past decade we have been home to several major research projects funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), looking at topics such as photography, surrealism and Latin American art.
Our expert staff
The support provided by your supervisor is a key feature of your experience as a research student. Your supervisor will guide you through the different stages of your research degree. Initially, your supervisor helps you to develop your research topic and plan; then, you participate in regular one-to-one meetings to comment on drafts, resolve problems and maintain progress on your research.
We are a dynamic group of art historians who investigate the production and reception of images and built environment, across cultures and media, from the late medieval period to the present day.
Our staff's
research interests include activist art, modernist art and totalitarianism, the relationship between art and science, the artistic status of body modification, art and the environment, critical heritage, and the visual culture of social problems. We also have significant experience in curation and public engagement. Recent projects include:
Paola Di Giuseppantonio Di Franco's UKRI Future Leaders-funded research project, REPLACE
Matt Lodder's
Painted People: Humanity in 21 Tattoos
(HarperCollins, 2022)
Diana Bullen Presciutti's
Saints, Miracles, and Social Problems in Italian Renaissance Art
(Cambridge, 2023)
Specialist facilities
By studying within our
School of Philosophical, Historical and Interdisciplinary Studies
, you will have access to a range 
of outstanding facilities to aid your learning and research.
We provide good facilities for postgraduate study, with access to a range of resources and 
support mechanisms to foster progression. Our School is home to the Centre for Curatorial Studies, 
which brings together research in the field of museology, exhibition studies and curatorial practice, 
and also delivers our postgraduate courses in each of these areas.
We are also home to the
Essex Collection of Art from Latin America (ESCALA)
.
Your future
Many of our graduates are now working in academic institutions, in national or regional museums or galleries, or in other arts-related professions, both throughout the UK and abroad. Several graduates are now Professors in leading art history departments such as CUNY, while others have worked as curators at high-profile museums such as the Tate Modern.

Structure
Course structure
A research degree doesn't have a taught structure, giving you the chance to investigate your chosen topic in real depth and reach a profound understanding. In communicating that understanding, through a thesis or other means, you have a rare opportunity to generate knowledge. A research degree allows you to develop new high-level skills, enhance your professional development and build new networks. It can open doors to many careers.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
