Health and Social Care (School of)
Improving the physical, social or emotional lives of adults can take place in charities, homes or creative environments. This programme is an excellent opportunity for new students to gain vital skills and the adaptability to enter the changing UK workforce. It has also been designed in line with
The Care Certificate
, an agreed set of standards expected of support worker roles in the health and social care sectors.
Our lecturers believe that administering high-quality care begins with the empathy and kindness of the practitioner, and this course is ideal for anyone who is conscientious and eager to receive realistic practice in patient care. You will be able to learn through flexible and social teaching to guide you from the start of your journey to becoming competent and confident to apply for further education or to roles in the sector.
If you're new to health care (or are in work), you will gradually receive simulated learning experiences, lectures and seminars on campus so that when you are caring for individuals in need – you are familiar with equipment, potential hazards and will feel informed to make life-saving decisions.
The opportunity to train in workshops without the real consequences of errors with vulnerable patients will enable you to deliver better support, communication and kindness when you do begin to practice in varying locations across the UK and beyond.
Location
This course is taught at both our Colchester and Southend campuses.
Why we're great.
You will be provided realistic practice for developing your proficiency in patient care, through consistent simulation scenarios throughout the programme.
Lectures will be taught by staff from varied health and social care backgrounds from within the School of Health and Social Care, including Nursing, Speech & Language Therapy, Occupational Therapy and Social Work.
We have state-of-the-art teaching facilities including mock wards at both campuses.

Structure
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100
4

Teaching
CertHE students will be given extensive simulated learning opportunities to develop the knowledge and skills required for these roles, giving students an understanding of complex nature of working in health and social care settings in a safe and controlled environment. This will be facilitated by a range of health and social care professionals, giving students insight into a broad range of practices, approaches and further study opportunities.
On  this programme you will usually spend 2 days per week on campus, including one day per week spent in our mock wards where you will develop your clinical skills.
Assessment
Learning outcomes are not seen by teaching staff as the threshold for obtaining a pass but are seen as baseline standards that students require to develop on their journey to becoming lifelong learners.
The assessment methods will ensure that different students' learning needs and preferences are met, regardless of their backgrounds, learning styles or abilities. This will include considering feedback timing and ensuring that assessment briefs are easily accessible to all students.
