International business and entrepreneurial expansion is a desirable business strategy as it opens more avenues for revenue, but careful consideration must be paid to differences in how countries and cultural nuance impact business decisions.
Our MSc International Business and Entrepreneurship explores the theoretical and practical aspects of starting, growing and developing businesses across international borders.

You explore topics including:
international expansion models
applying economic theory to business management
international trade theories and practices
international business environments
economic, sociological, psychological and managerial theories of entrepreneurship
how to develop an international business plan

“Essex gave me the opportunity to meet different people and expand my awareness of the different cultures that exist in the world. Although my time was short there which just one year, I learned a lot you know. I would give anything to have the fond memories I had when I was in Essex because it was such a profound experience that 1 year of my time was not enough. I am glad that I went to Essex, there were a lot of challenges, mistakes I made, toes I stepped on but all in all, it was an amazing experience I had.”
“I am now a Mental Health Counsellor. I never thought I would do my present job. At first, I wanted to be a graphic designer in the 3D and animation industry and although I love graphic design I feel I find more happiness and joy in my present career. I studied Entrepreneurship in Essex, so It was very relevant in my current career.”
Charles Omofuma Ituah, MSc International Business and Entrepreneurship

We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website.

Components and modules explained

Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
