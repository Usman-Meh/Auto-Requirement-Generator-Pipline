Course:
Economics
Start date:

Study mode:
Full-time
Duration:
1 year
Location:
Colchester Campus
Based in:
Economics
How should trade be managed to promote both social welfare and the interests of workers and firms? How should merger policy be managed to balance the interests of merging firms and others that share the industry? How should financial markets and financial instruments be designed to promote economic stability and growth?
If your first degree isn't in economics, or your economics training doesn't provide sufficient experience for our MSc courses, MA Economics may be for you.
At Essex we push the frontiers of accepted wisdom, critically examining the decisions of individuals, the strategies of firms, and the policies of governments to understand and challenge the standard paradigms of economics. On this course, you build a thorough understanding of the key areas of economics through studying these topics:
Strategic behaviour, public choice, fiscal and monetary policy, theories of growth
Modern theory and methods with application to policy
Formal economic arguments, and the role of equilibrium
Econometric methods
We teach you the essentials of micro- and macroeconomics and econometric methods. You also have the option to explore a set of selected topics in economics to hone your skills, such as Management Economics and Market Analysis, International Trade and Financial Economics.
For your dissertation, you apply these skills to create an original piece of research. If you need it, we support you in maths through pre-sessional and co-curricular support.  If you'd like to develop your knowledge further at Essex, we offer a range of other advanced courses inside and outside economics that complement this course.
We are 4th in UK for research power in economics and econometrics (Times Higher Education research power measure, Research Excellence Framework 2021). Much of this world-class research is related to policy, and we have
research strengths
in a number of areas.
The quality of our work is reflected in our stream of publications in high-profile academic journals, including American Economic Review, Econometrica, and Review of Economic Studies.
With this course you also have the opportunity to study abroad at one of our partner institutions and achieve a dual award, which means you'll receive two Masters degrees in two years. Find out more on our
dual award webpage.

Structure
Course structure
Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The following modules are based on the current course structure and may change in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100
4
FY
The department or school the module will be taught by.
In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History.
The module number.
The
UK academic level
of the module.
A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.
A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.

COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY
Introductory Macroeconomics
(20 CREDITS)
Introductory Macroeconomics studies some of the fundamental concepts and methods in economics. It equips you with the basic tools and methods of analysis used in economic reasoning. You are introduced to National income accounting, the basics of fiscal and monetary policies in the short run, and the critical role of the Government's budget constraint.

The module then progresses into a discussion of the trade-off between inflation and unemployment and the role of the natural rate of unemployment. Particular emphasis is applied to understanding how macroeconomics can help understanding the economic environment we live in and the most important economic challenges we face.
View Introductory Macroeconomics on our Module Directory
COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY
Introductory Microeconomics
(20 CREDITS)
Microeconomics studies the economic behaviour of individual economic decision makers such as consumers, workers, firms, or managers. You will be looking at decision-making and markets when all agents have perfect information about goods and prices and individual agents cannot affect prices through their own actions. Later in the module you will turn to the concept of market equilibrium with more detailed understanding of demand and supply in order to derive properties of market behaviour.

COMPONENT 04: COMPULSORY
Introductory Econometrics
(20 CREDITS)
This module provides an introduction to the econometric methods commonly used to analyse economic data and the application of these methods. The focus of the module is on linear regression and the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation procedure. This is introduced after a review of basic probability, random variables, simple descriptive statistics and the concept of the null hypothesis.
