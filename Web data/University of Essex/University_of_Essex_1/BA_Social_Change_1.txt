If you're looking to change the world, our BA Social Change is designed for you. With increasing awareness of global issues, there has never been a more vital time to contribute meaningfully to social change. In this course, you'll tackle issues from ethics to sustainability and gain a historical perspective on the forces that have shaped our multicultural and interconnected world.
On this flexible degree, you'll broaden your knowledge whilst acquiring the tools required to address today's pressing social problems, transform society and make a positive change in an increasingly globalised world. Through social action projects and by participating in group community projects, you'll gain practical experiences and develop the high-level transferrable skills required to make a real-world difference. Along the way, you'll build the skills needed to take on global challenges as an effective social change leader.
BA Social Change will equip you with the theoretical and practical skills required of a future change-maker. Throughout the course you'll cover key areas including but not limited to:
Community engagement
Sustainability
Human rights
Social justice
Individualism

Why we're great.
You can tailor your degree to suit your unique interests and goals by choosing from a range of modules.
Our courses can also be taken as a four-year option including a year of study abroad or a work placement.
You are taught by a team of international experts in a range of subjects.
Study abroad
Your education extends beyond our University campus. We support you in this by providing the option of an additional year. The five-year version of our degree allows you to spend the fourth year studying abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the four-year course.
Studying abroad allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.
If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university

Alternatively, you can spend your third year on a placement year with an external organisation, where you learn about a particular sector, company or job role, apply your academic knowledge in a practical working environment, and receive inspiration for future career pathways.

Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory

Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the

Interdisciplinary Research and Problem-Solving: An Introduction
(15 CREDITS)
Ours is a world that seems to be shaking at its very foundations. Ideas that have shaped the way we see ourselves and the world around us – ideas like democracy, free speech, citizenship, political authority, individualism, free markets, and human rights – are contested at every turn.

These ideas took their definitive modern form during a period of political and intellectual upheaval known as the Enlightenment (ca. 1650-1800). If we want to navigate our way through the chaos of today, then we need to return to the roots of our contemporary world – the Enlightenment.

This interdisciplinary module explores this revolutionary period so that we can better understand our world today and bring about the world we want tomorrow. We will focus on political revolutions, on societal inequality, sickness, and control, and the dark side of technology. Graduating students often rank it among the most useful modules they've taken.

The World in Question: The Social, Cultural, Political & Environmental Legacies of the Enlightenment
(30 CREDITS)
How have contemporary societies been shaped by the legacies of the Enlightenment, colonialism, and the different phases of capitalism?  This interdisciplinary module helps you to critically understand some of the key forces and processes that have shaped the challenges we face in the 20th and 21st century.  It is divided into three broad themes; Empire, The Self, and Nature.  We’ll be examining processes of ‘othering’ that were intrinsic to colonialism; changing conceptions of the self; as well as both the causes of and potential solutions to the ecological crisis we are confronting today. The module is co-taught by academics from Art History, ISC, LiFTs, Philosophy, Psychoanalytic Studies and Sociology.
This module has been designed to enable students to integrate their subject knowledge with an understanding of sustainable development, acquiring the skills and competencies essential for addressing the urgent sustainability challenges of the 21st century.

It also gives you the opportunity to develop your skills and use your creativity and imagination to design your own project or enterprise.
