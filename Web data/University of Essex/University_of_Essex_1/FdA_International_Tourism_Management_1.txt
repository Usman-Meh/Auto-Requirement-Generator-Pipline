The global tourism industry's contribution to GDP was approximately 7.7 trillion USD in 2022. There were over 295 million jobs in the sector, a number which is expected to increase to 430 million by 2033. Incorporating many industries such as accommodation, transport, attractions and more, it saw a huge surge after pandemic restrictions were lifted, with its percentage share of the global market almost fully returned to pre-pandemic numbers. Both domestically and internationally, the sector plays a crucial part in many economies, with more people joining the industry every year.
After completing the FdA you will have the opportunity, subject to satisfactory performance, to continue with your studies and finish with a
BA degree.
This course is not suitable if you need a Student visa to study in the UK.
With a student experience unlike any other, it may come as no surprise that the Edge Hotel School is ranked in the top 10 in the UK for overall positivity in our subject area (National Student Survey 2024, English broad discipline higher education institutions).
Studying FdA Tourism at the Edge Hotel School will prepare you to take up management roles in the UK or overseas in cruise ships, airlines, events and visitor attractions or travel and holiday organisations. The course includes integrated work experience across various departments in Wivenhoe House during your first year, a 4* country house hotel on Essex's Colchester campus, as well as integrating contributions from industry speakers, consultancy projects and live project experiences.
Whilst your time in the hotel will help you understand how hospitality businesses work, the main highlight will be your time working alongside various tourism businesses on collaborative projects. You'll be studying in Britain's oldest recorded city filled with a rich history that attracts tourists from all over the world. Geographically close to London, the coast and with six international airports within 2 hours from campus, you'll be working with local tourism hubs and teams at the city's main tourist attractions such as Colchester Castle and Visit Essex.
