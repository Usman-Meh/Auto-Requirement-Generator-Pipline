The details
Course:
Scriptwriting (Theatre and Digital Media)
Start date:
October 2025
Study mode:
Full-time
Duration:
1 year
Location:
Colchester Campus
Based in:
Literature, Film, and Theatre Studies
Develop as a scriptwriter by learning with professional and award-winning dramatists. On our MA Scriptwriting (Theatre and Digital Media) you produce a varied portfolio of dramatic works, culminating in a full-length original script, whether for the stage, screen, radio or television, which will enable you to hone and develop your own unique voice.
At Essex, we believe that the joint engagement of practice and theory produces a deep understanding of how drama works. We combine critical study of dramatic texts with practical workshops, so that you nurture your understanding of the scriptwriter's craft in order to produce your own new work.
Our course focuses on the range of possibilities that exist for contemporary drama, with an emphasis on British and Irish drama, and you also explore topics including:
The principles of dramatic structure and scene construction (dialogue, the construction of plot, the development of character, development of themes, and the structure of scenes)
The origins and possibilities of poetic theatre and verse drama
Writing and developing screenplays
Options for poetic practice or novel-writing
Students would usually attend a two-hour seminar for each module each week. Seminar groups would usually have about 10-15 students.
Your dissertation gives you the chance to write a full-length script with one-to-one supervision from an award-winning scriptwriting tutor.
