Our BA Modern Languages and Teaching English as a Foreign Language (including foundation year) is open to Home and EU students. It will be suitable for you if your academic qualifications do not yet meet our entrance requirements for the three-year version of this course and you want a programme that increases your subject knowledge as well as improves your academic skills.
This five-year course includes a foundation year (Year Zero), followed by a further four years of study. During your Year Zero, you study four academic subjects relevant to your chosen course as well as a compulsory academic skills module.
You are an Essex student from day one, a member of our global community based at the most internationally diverse campus university in the UK.
After successful completion of Year Zero in our
Essex Pathways Department
, you progress to complete your course with the Department of
Department of Language and Linguistics
. Our course is ideal if you want to teach English to non-native speakers, but the knowledge and skills you develop will also prepare you for a range of other possible careers in the media, in administration, in business and in education; in fact, any job where the ability to apply critical thinking to problems, to conduct independent research and to communicate the results of your work to others are required.
You study topics which give you a thorough grounding in English Language, and teaching English Language to others, including:
Linguistics and sociolinguistics
The structure of the English language
Second language learning
Practical training in TEFL methods
You also study up to two of the languages offered at Essex: French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Mandarin Chinese, completing at least one language to Mastery level. Each of these languages is widely used in the business world, and can take you to a level of near-fluency, and so many of our graduates go on to develop successful global careers with international firms looking for language specialists.
We also offer a month-long summer course with fees paid for by us if you start a language from scratch via the intensive route.
We are a place where talented students become part of an academic community in which the majority of research is rated ‘world-leading' or ‘internationally excellent'. We are 1st in UK for research impact in modern languages and linguistics (Grade Point Average, Research Excellence Framework 2021) and top 25 in the UK for linguistics in the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2024.
If you want a global outlook, are interested in human communication, and want to study for a degree with real-world practical value in a world-class department, welcome to Essex.
Why we're great.
Great flexibility and choice: You can study up to three languages choosing between French, German, Italian and Spanish from beginner or post-A level standard. Mandarin Chinese is available at beginner's level.
We specialise in developing translation, interpreting and subtitling skills at undergraduate level using the latest technology in our multimedia labs.
Our study abroad opportunities include studying at a partner university, an overseas work placement or undertaking a British Council Language Assistantship
Study abroad
Our course offers two possibilities for your year abroad. The first allows you to study at one of the prestigious universities with which we have
exchange links
. You continue to study modules relevant to your course, learning your chosen languages within a country that speaks them.
The second option allows you to work as a language assistant, thereby acquiring valuable professional experience in an international context in addition to earning money.
Whichever option you choose, your year abroad allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.
If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university
Our expert staff
We have some of the best teachers across the University in our Essex Pathways Department, all of whom have strong subject backgrounds and are highly skilled in their areas.
Our staff
are internationally renowned. Their books dominate the reading lists at other universities. We maintain excellent student-staff ratios, and we integrate language learning with linguistics wherever there is synergy.
In addition to helping you acquire practical foreign language skills, our staff share their expertise with you in the areas of theoretical linguistics, sociolinguistics, applied linguistics, and psycholinguistics.
Specialist facilities
By studying within our Essex Pathways Department for your foundation year, you will have access to all of the facilities that the University of Essex has to offer, as well as those provided by our Academy to support you:
We provide computer labs for internet research; classrooms with access to PowerPoint facilities for student presentations; AV facilities for teaching and access to web-based learning materials
Our new Student Services Hub will support you and provide information for all your needs as a student
Our social space is stocked with hot magazines and newspapers, and provides an informal setting to meet with your lecturers, tutors and friends
In our Department of Language and Linguistics you also have access to:
Our
Languages for All
programme offers you the opportunity to study an additional language alongside your course at no extra cost
A new 20-position
Interpreting Lab
Extra-curricular activities are available through student societies
Your future
Companies and organisations in the UK and abroad are struggling to find university graduates who are fluent in at least one other language, apart from English.
Being an Essex modern languages graduate places you in a very advantageous position. You will be able to speak and write fluently, or to a very competent standard, in up to four languages. Language skills are in scarce supply and can be used in almost any job.
Our graduates become teachers, translators, administrators and journalists. Their valued language skills have enabled them to work in diverse fields including banking, entertainment, media, education and tourism, as well as for a host of UK and international companies. In particular, a degree in modern languages lends itself to a career in education, translation, interpretation, trade, PR, communications, immigration or diplomacy.
For example, one of our recent graduates is now a newspaper editor in Spain, while another teaches modern languages in Southampton.
We also work with the University's
Student Development Team
to help you find out about further work experience, internships, placements, and voluntary opportunities.

Structure
Course structure
We offer a flexible course structure with a mixture of compulsory and optional modules chosen from relevant lists.
The nature of this course is such that your individual programme will differ depending upon your pre-existing language qualifications/ the language(s) you choose to study during your course.
Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The course content is therefore reviewed on an annual basis to ensure our courses remain up-to-date so modules listed are subject to change.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained

Meaning is seen as closely related to general knowledge; grammar as shaped and constrained by general cognitive processes, by the needs of speakers in interaction, and by frequency of use. The module covers key concepts in the field, such as conceptualisation and construal, radial networks, encyclopaedic knowledge and its role in language comprehension and production, metaphor and metonymy, and embodied cognition.
