How is climate change linked to policy and policy makers? How does climate change impact upon the world's economies?
There is a rapidly growing need to understand the nature and consequences of the climate crisis, and to develop evidence-led strategies to respond. Our MSc in Environmental Futures with Climate Change will provide you with rigorous training to better understand the causes and impact of climate change and to formulate strategies and solutions.  The programme will provide you with knowledge of how climate change science is linked to policy and policy makers, and will develop a foundation to understand prevention of the climate crisis and mitigation/adaptation that is grounded in the social, natural and environmental sciences.  You will learn the scientific evidence that is needed for policymakers and societies to respond to these global challenges impacting the natural capital and the world's economies.
You will also learn and apply the appropriate research methods to study the environment and climate change, and will be fully prepared and supported to conduct a dissertation project on a relevant topic.
You will be able to formulate theories that are amenable to multivariate hypothesis testing and will be able to implement advanced regression models in R. You will also learn how to handle complex data structures and implement the appropriate models for research in environmental studies. The programme provides a strong foundation for PhD research, but is also ideal for employment in a wide range of public and private industries, including government agencies, consultancies and NGOs/charities.
If you like the sound of our MSc Environmental Futures with Climate Change course but are less interested in quantitative analysis and complex data structures, the
MA version
of this course may be for you.
The world needs Essex graduates now more than ever, welcome home.
Why we're great.
You will gain a solid foundation in not just how environmental policy is approached from the social sciences but also from physical science as well

to request the entry requirements for this country.
English language requirements
If English is not your first language, we require IELTS 6.5 overall with a minimum
 score of 5.5 in all components.
If you do not meet our IELTS requirements then you may be able to complete a
pre-sessional English
pathway
that enables you to start your course without retaking IELTS.
Additional Notes
The University uses academic selection criteria to determine an applicant’s ability to
successfully complete a course at the University of Essex. Where appropriate, we may ask
for specific information relating to previous modules studied or work experience.
Structure
Course structure
Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The following modules are based on the current course structure and may change in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.
The MSc also contains the
GV903 Advanced Research Methods
core module. 
We recommend the MSc to applicants who have already received basic statistical training in their undergraduate course. Choose the (otherwise identical) MA instead if you have not had an introduction to statistics.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100
4
FY
The department or school the module will be taught by.
In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History.

The
UK academic level
of the module.
A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.
A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.

COMPONENT 01: COMPULSORY
Introduction to Quantitative Methods and Data Analysis I
(15 CREDITS)
This module offers you an introduction to the theory and practice of quantitative data analysis techniques. You will also be introduced to the computer package R, which is widely used by academics and practitioners for the analysis of quantitative data. As the work becomes more challenging, the relevance of the techniques to modern social science research becomes more apparent.
View Introduction to Quantitative Methods and Data Analysis I on our Module Directory
COMPONENT 02: CORE
Comparative Environmental Politics
(15 CREDITS)
Study one of the most important contemporary aspects of political action: the natural environment. You consider the state of the environment and possible paths along which it might change, before exploring environmental policies from the level of individual values to the environmental movement to political parties, and finally to the level of international affairs.

COMPONENT 03: CORE
Climate Change and Pollution
(15 CREDITS)
Earth`s climate has fluctuated throughout history, but the speed of change in recent decades has been unprecedented. Warming, acidification, drought, flooding, and fire are increasingly prevalent features of our modern world.

In addition, humans are responsible for widespread environmental pollution, which is any input of material or energy into air, land, or water that causes harmful environment change.

The sources and ecological consequences of climate change and pollution will be explored and discussed, concentrating on biodiversity, species distributions and extinctions, and the provision of ecosystem services of benefit to humans.

Examples of climate change and pollution will be presented from both terrestrial and aquatic domains, and from polar to tropical biomes, together with a review of the avenues to be followed for remediation of biosphere processes and the conservation of biological diversity. The module will be delivered through lectures and a practical session incorporating data analysis and interpretation.

COMPONENT 06: COMPULSORY
Research Design
(15 CREDITS)
In this module you gain an overview of the logic of social science research designs that includes the goals, theories and strategies of social science research, and develop a research agenda for potential use as publication in a peer reviewed journal, MA or PhD dissertation.
