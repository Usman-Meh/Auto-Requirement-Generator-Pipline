What's the difference between financial and management accounting? How can accountants help improve business for the better?
Accounting informs almost all areas of business, from strategy to outsourcing and operational planning to environmental policies. At
Essex Business School
,  accounting means more than cutting costs and managing transactions. It's vital for ensuring accountability by encouraging sound, ethical decision making so that you can make a positive impact in the workplace.
From an undergraduate accounting degree at Essex you gain a firm understanding of the financial drivers underpinning business leadership, strategy, planning, governance and ethics. You explore both financial and management accounting and use case studies to apply theory to practice, skills which will be in an increasingly high demand from employers over the coming years.
You'll gain a broad understanding of accounting and benefit from academic expertise in a range of areas, studying topics such as:
preparation and analysis of financial statements
regulation in governing accounting practice
principles of cost accumulation
financial and management accounting theory
providing information to managers to assist their decision making
We ensure you gain a fully-rounded business education by introducing you to subjects such as finance and management in your first year. In your second and final years, you can choose from selected optional modules to tailor the programme to your accounting career aspirations.
In your final year of your accounting degree, you have the opportunity to put your knowledge into practice by completing an in-depth, independent research project or dissertation. This will give you the chance to further develop vital employability skills in areas of research, time management and critical thinking.
You join an international community of students and staff, working to make organisations better places to do business.

Structure
Course structure
The course structure is designed to cover everything a future accountant would need to know, as well as taking a wider look at the industry. Some modules will focus mainly on the numbers whilst others will put these into perspective and teach you how managers use accounting information to make decisions.
In the first year our current students cover wider business topics that every manager needs to know. However, we are planning some changes to our first year and we'll be tailoring it more closely to your chosen course. In second and third year you'll have optional modules and by picking certain modules you'll be able to maximise the number of exemptions available to you from bodies such as ACCA, helping you on the way to achieving chartered status. There's also flexibility to study non-accounting modules through your options.
We offer a flexible course structure with a mixture of core/compulsory modules, and optional modules chosen from lists. Please be aware that we are planning changes to our first year to make it more relevant to your chosen course.
Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The following modules are based on the current course structure and may change in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.

Changes to courses may for example consist of variations to the content and method of delivery of programmes, courses and other services, to discontinue programmes, courses and other services and to merge or combine programmes or courses. The University will endeavour to keep such changes to a minimum, and will also keep students informed appropriately by updating our
