"I graduated from Essex with a BSc Computer Science degree and am currently working as a Site Reliability Engineer for Google. My focus is on Google’s API gateway software, which is also used on Google Cloud. My experience at Essex helped tremendously in enabling me to get to where I am now. Every day I make use of the skills I gained during my studies, not to mention the practical experience I received. My placement year at Rolls-Royce was a fantastic and invaluable opportunity, which allowed me to develop control software for the Trent 7000 engine. Aircraft with this engine are probably in the air even now!"

Examples of such reasons might include, but are not limited to: strikes, other industrial action, staff illness, severe weather, fire, civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist attack or threat of terrorist attack (whether declared or not), natural disaster, restrictions imposed by government or public authorities, epidemic or pandemic disease, failure of public utilities or transport systems or the withdrawal/reduction of funding. Changes to courses may for example consist of variations to the content and method of delivery of programmes, courses and other services, to discontinue programmes, courses and other services and to merge or combine programmes or courses. The University will endeavour to keep such changes to a minimum, and will also keep students informed appropriately by updating our
programme specifications
. The University would inform and engage with you if your course was to be discontinued, and would provide you with options, where appropriate, in line with our Compensation and Refund Policy.
The full Procedures, Rules and Regulations of the University governing how it operates are set out in the Charter, Statutes and
Ordinances and in the University Regulations, Policy and Procedures.
