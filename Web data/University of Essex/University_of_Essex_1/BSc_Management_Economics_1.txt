Economics
How can economic ideas and principles help us to understand how organisations work and industries function? What role do economic principles play in management decisions and in the analysis of strategic interactions among businesses and organisations? Unlike conventional management courses, at Essex you analyse the economics of a business or organisation and investigate how they operate and behave.
You develop your abilities in economics and gain confidence in applying them to organisational management, as well as receiving expert training in quantitative research methods. You gain a thorough understanding of how businesses function and develop your analytical, modelling and research skills through studying topics including:
Managing people and practices
Marketing
Monopoly power and regulation
Applying economic techniques to managing new technologies
The impact of business decisions on products, prices, and social welfare
We are 4th in UK for research power in economics and econometrics (Times Higher Education research power measure, Research Excellence Framework 2021).
Management economics gives you a valuable grounding in economics, with a particular focus on how companies work. We provide you with a greater understanding of the how firms operate, teaching you how resources are allocated within a company, why a company is structured in a particular way, and how these structures affect the overall economy.
This ensures that you graduate having received a strong training in management economics.
Why we're great.
We are 4th in UK for research power in economics and econometrics (Times Higher Education research power measure, Research Excellence Framework 2021)
We're 7th in the UK and 1st for value-added for economics in the Guardian University Guide 2024
Get hands-on experience in the world of investment banking with the Student Investment and Trading Fund (SIT Fund) - a unique initiative in the East of England. Participate in an investment bootcamp run by Essex alumni who are now investment bankers, before pitching your investment recommendations and monitoring their success.
Study abroad
Your education extends beyond the university campus. We support you in expanding your education through offering the opportunity to spend a year or a term studying abroad at one of our partner universities. The four-year version of our degree allows you to spend the third year abroad or employed on a placement abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the three-year course.
Studying abroadÂ allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.
If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university.
Placement year
Alternatively, you can spend your third year on a
placement year
with an external organisation, where you learn about a particular sector, company or job role, apply your academic knowledge in a practical working environment, and receive inspiration for future career pathways. You will be responsible for finding your placement, but with support and guidance provided by both your department and our Employability and Careers Centre.
If you complete a placement year you'll only pay 20% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year.

Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course.Â A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules fromÂ which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100
