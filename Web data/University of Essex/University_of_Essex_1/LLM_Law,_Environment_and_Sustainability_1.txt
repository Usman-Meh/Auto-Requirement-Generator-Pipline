Course:

Start date:
October 2025
Study mode:
Full-time
Duration:
1 year
Location:

Based in:
Essex Law School
The international community faces considerable challenges in achieving sustainability relating to all aspects of the environment and development. These goals include the need to achieve social justice and economic resilience, and as such pose complex legal and policy questions.
Law plays an integral role in these processes as its development affects and influences the decision-making of governments and businesses, and impacts directly upon communities and the environments in which they live.
Our LLM Law, Environment and Sustainability course offers the opportunity to study across a wide range of modules in the areas of environmental law, development law, international law, corporate and commercial law, human rights, corporate responsibility, trade and investment law to enable you to become technically capable in these areas and to enhance your analytical, communication and advocacy skills needed to operate effectively within these spheres.
You will learn about the legal and non-mandatory obligations that relate to different national and international actors, and the tensions that exist within different legal systems and frameworks of law that sometimes represent competing environmental, political, economic, social and developmental priorities.
Throughout the degree you will have the opportunity to study key areas, including but not limited to:
International Environmental Law and Sustainability
Human Rights, Development and the Environment
Trade, Investment, Environment and Human Rights
Corporate Responsibility and Business Law
International Law of the Sea
Business and Human Rights
Public International Law
The degree also uniquely enables students to study other optional subjects that include specific components that relate directly to the environment and sustainability. These include:
Economic Social and Cultural Rights.
Acute Crises and Displacement
Human Rights, Global Diversity and Global Challenges
Competition Law
Conflict and the United Nations: The Law Related to the Use of Force, Sanctions and Peacekeeping
Corporate Governance Models and Principles
International Trade and Maritime Law
Law of Armed Conflict
Maritime Law and Wet Shipping
Therefore you will be able to tailor your LLM to your own specific interests and requirements.
The degree will develop your intellectual and critical faculties, encourage you to think independently and teach you to present rational, coherent and accurate arguments orally and in writing. It will provide you with an excellent foundation for a wide range of careers.
We are ranked 49th for Law in THE World University Rankings by subject 2024, which is 9th in the UK, and we are 3rd in the UK for research power in law (THE research power measure, REF2021).
This course is also available on a part-time basis.
As part of the degree, you will be required to research and write dissertation which is normally between 12-15,000 words. Supervision and guidance is provided.

Structure
Course structure
We offer a flexible course structure with a mixture of core/compulsory modules, and optional modules chosen from lists.
Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The course content is therefore reviewed on an annual basis to ensure our courses remain up-to-date so modules listed are subject to change.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course.Â A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules fromÂ which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

This module is a compulsory module for all LLM in International Law students on all pathways, which aims to develop studentsâ€™ academic skills as required for the postgraduate study of international law.

The LW949 Academic Skills in International Law module equips students with the technical skills required to engage in research and study of public international law, including academic referencing of scholarship, treaties, cases of international courts and tribunals. Students also develop the necessary skills to analyse international legal materials, complete both essay and problem-based questions within the field, produce high-quality independent writing at postgraduate level, and reflect upon feedback.
This module will also prepare students for the foundation essay (formative essay) for the LLM in International Law. This is a formative essay, which provides an opportunity for students to engage with postgraduate level reading and writing on a topic of international law, and to submit an essay for the first time at LLM level. As a valuable learning tool, students receive feedback on their foundation essay, allowing them to reflect accordingly for future coursework with a view on how to further develop their skills throughout their postgraduate degree.
