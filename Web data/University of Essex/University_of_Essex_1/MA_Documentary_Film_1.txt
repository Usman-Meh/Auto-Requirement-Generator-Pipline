Duration:

Are you aiming to take your interests in documentary and non-fiction film to the next level? Over recent years documentary has significantly expanded its reach, becoming a central mode for raising awareness, educating, informing, and even entertaining. This one-year full-time (or two-year part-time) Masters course draws on the University's internationally recognized expertise in documentary filmmaking, film history, and theory. Students will hone their skills in nonfiction and reality filmmaking and reflect critically and historically on the process.
This course is about producing cutting-edge, personal, and socially relevant work. There will be an option to tailor your studies by choosing a dissertation project that is either a single film or shorter films, with a written critical component. Those who have little or no background in documentary film are welcome, but a portfolio or other evidence of potential filmmaking skills would be an advantage. This MA course is open to people with degrees in other fields or with equivalent professional experience.
Why we're great.
This course offers a hands-on approach to learning from conceptualization to production and post-production, students gain invaluable experience in all aspects of documentary filmmaking.
Students benefit from the guidance of a diverse faculty team comprised of industry professionals and experienced academics.
With access to state-of-the-art facilities and resources, students have the freedom to experiment with various storytelling techniques and formats, while also collaborating with peers on interdisciplinary projects.

English language requirements
If English is not your first language, we require a minimum IELTS score of 7.0 overall with a minimum score of  6.5 in writing and 5.5 in all other components.
If you do not meet our IELTS requirements then you may be able to complete a
pre-sessional English

Additional Notes
The University uses academic selection criteria to determine an applicant’s ability to
successfully complete a course at the University of Essex. Where appropriate, we may ask
for specific information relating to previous modules studied or work experience.
Structure
Course structure
We offer a flexible course structure with a mixture of core/compulsory modules, and optional modules chosen from lists.
Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The course content is therefore reviewed on an annual basis to ensure our courses remain up-to-date so modules listed are subject to change.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
