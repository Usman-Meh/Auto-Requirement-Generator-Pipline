Are you aiming to take your interests in documentary and non-fiction film to the next level? Over recent years documentary has significantly expanded its reach, becoming a central mode for raising awareness, educating, informing, and even entertaining. This one-year full-time (or two-year part-time) Masters course draws on the University's internationally recognized expertise in documentary filmmaking, film history, and theory. Students will hone their skills in nonfiction and reality filmmaking and reflect critically and historically on the process.
This course is about producing cutting-edge, personal, and socially relevant work. There will be an option to tailor your studies by choosing a dissertation project that is either a single film or shorter films, with a written critical component. Those who have little or no background in documentary film are welcome, but a portfolio or other evidence of potential filmmaking skills would be an advantage. This MA course is open to people with degrees in other fields or with equivalent professional experience.
Why we're great.
This course offers a hands-on approach to learning from conceptualization to production and post-production, students gain invaluable experience in all aspects of documentary filmmaking.
Students benefit from the guidance of a diverse faculty team comprised of industry professionals and experienced academics.
With access to state-of-the-art facilities and resources, students have the freedom to experiment with various storytelling techniques and formats, while also collaborating with peers on interdisciplinary projects.

Course structure
We offer a flexible course structure with a mixture of core/compulsory modules, and optional modules chosen from lists.

We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
