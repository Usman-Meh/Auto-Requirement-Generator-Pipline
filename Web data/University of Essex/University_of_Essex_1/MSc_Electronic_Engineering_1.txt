Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100

COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY
Theory of Signals and Communication Systems
(15 CREDITS)
This module provides a mathematical foundation for the study of communication systems and understanding their operation. It covers at depth the relevant mathematical concepts, such as Fourier transforms, theory of probability and stochastic processes and noise, as well as fundamentals of information theory and coding. The key feature of the module is that all relevant mathematical concepts are considered together with practical demonstration of their direct applications to the related area of electronic engineering and communication. In order to provide both good theoretical knowledge and strong applied skills, in addition to the lectures the module is supported by the problem solving classes. The module uses these theoretical tools to examine the operation of modern communication systems, such as analogue and digital signal processing and applications of information theory to data coding. The module also covers analysis of fundamental performance bounds, and identifies how close commercially important systems are to these bounds.

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY
Introduction to Programming in Python
(15 CREDITS)
The aim of this module is to provide an introduction to computer programming for students with little or no previous experience.  The Python language is used in the Linux environment, and students are given a comprehensive introduction to both during the module.  The emphasis is on developing the practical skills necessary to write effective programs, with examples taken principally from the realm of data processing and analysis.  You will learn how to manipulate and analyse data, graph them and fit models to them.  Teaching takes place in workshop-style sessions in a software laboratory, so you can try things out as soon as you learn about them.

COMPONENT 05: COMPULSORY
Electronic System Design and Integration
(15 CREDITS)
This module provides first-hand experience of the design simulation and production of complex electronic circuits. A word specification is provided for a consumer electronics device for which a prototype is designed using reference and first principles. The circuit is then simulated and tested in Multisim to verify operation. Once satisfactory, a hardware prototype is developed on a prototype medium e.g. breadboard and tested in real-world conditions. Then using PCB design software, a PCB is designed and populated to produce the final product. The module has a large emphasis on the practical with a lighter emphasis on the theoretical.

COMPONENT 06: COMPULSORY
Professional Practice and Research Methodology
(15 CREDITS)
This module aims to prepare students for conducting an independent research project leading to a dissertation and to provide them with an appreciation of research and business skills related to their professional career. As a precursor to their project students, individually select an area of Computer Science, or Electronic Engineering, or Computational Finance and perform the necessary background research to define a topic and prepare a project proposal under the  guidance of a supervisor. The module guides them by a) introducing common research methods b) creating an understanding of basic statistics for describing and making conclusions from data c) helping to write a strong proposal including learning how to perform literature search and evaluation and d) giving an in-depth view into the business enterprise, financial and management accounting and investment appraisal.
