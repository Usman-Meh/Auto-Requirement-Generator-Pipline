How do we understand crime? Should crime be punished? Criminologists engage with some of the most pressing issues, decisions and dilemmas facing societies today. On our course you explore the nature of crime, criminal justice and punishment within wider social contexts.
Taught in partnership with our
Department of Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies
, this course explores crime and society, alongside counselling which examines the nature of emotional difficulties and human relationships. You learn to be more effective in your interpersonal functioning and to offer a mature, empathic and sensitive presence to employers and those that you work with.
You study an exciting range of topics including:
Criminal justice systems
Crime and media
Mental health and treatment
Skills for counselling
The counselling relationship
You receive training in sociological research methods including how to design a survey, conduct interviews and focus groups. Through modules delivered by the
Department of Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies
you're introduced to key concepts of psychodynamic thinking which is relevant for counselling. You gain insight into the unconscious dynamics in individuals and groups and develop listening and observation, self-reflectiveness and communication skills.
You're taught by criminologists and sociologists in our
Department of Sociology and Criminology
. Our counselling experts in our Department of Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic Studies offer a clinical and academic approach and are acclaimed professors, clinicians and practitioners who can offer relevant, practical experience.
You have the opportunity to gain practical experience and to pursue a year studying abroad or completing a work placement which can help in future employment. You can also complete a supervised dissertation on a topic that inspires you, encouraging you to think differently and connect with live issues and debates, preparing you for your graduate career.
Why we're great.
We're ranked 24th in the UK for criminology (The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2023)
Study within the Department of Sociology and Criminology, a pioneering department in the fields of sociology and criminology
You develop skills for a career in counselling alongside gaining an in depth insight into criminology
Study abroad
Your education extends beyond the university campus. We support you in expanding your education through offering the opportunity to spend a year or a term studying abroad at one of our partner universities. The four-year version of our degree allows you to spend the third year abroad or employed on a placement abroad, while otherwise remaining identical to the three-year course.
Studying abroad allows you to experience other cultures and languages, to broaden your degree socially and academically, and to demonstrate to employers that you are mature, adaptable, and organised.
If you spend a full year abroad you'll only pay 15% of your usual tuition fee to Essex for that year. You won't pay any tuition fees to your host university.
Placement year
You can also undertake a placement year in which you gain relevant work experience within an external business, giving you a competitive edge in the graduate job market and providing you with key contacts within the industry. You will be responsible for finding your placement, but with support and guidance provided by both your department and our
placements team
.
Our expert staff
Criminology at Essex is taught by an outstanding team including:  Professor Eamonn Carrabine (editor of the British Journal of Criminology),  Professor Pamela Cox (a consultant for the Victims' Commissioner), Professor Pete Fussey (an advisor to the Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner), Dr Kat Hadjimatheou (an advisor to the Home Office on domestic abuse), Prof Anna Sergi (an advisor to Interpol on organised crime) and Dr Sobie Kaker (member of Karachi Urban Lab).
But you may already be familiar with our academics before you meet them in lectures. As well as publishing core texts and bestselling books, our academics often appear on TV and radio.  Recent examples include Professor Mike Roper on The Psychology of War for the BBC World Service and Professor Pam Cox in her BBC TWO series Shopgirls: The True Story of Life Behind the Counter. Others engage with politics and policy making, such as those running our specialist centres for Migration Studies and Criminology.
Core staff on this programme include:
Dr Samuel Singler
Dr Samuel Singler's research covers the field of Border Criminology, focusing on the effects of novel border security technologies on the global criminalisation of migration. His empirical work on the International Organization for Migration's (IOM) capacity-building practices in Nigeria illuminates how and why security technologies diffuse across and through borders, how they shape contemporary â€˜crimmigration' policies, and how they are deployed and contested on the ground in post-colonial contexts.

Madness and its Cure
(15 CREDITS)
Why do we treat mental health disorders? Is it purely to reduce distress, or is something more complicated going on? Can treatments for mental ill health be interpreted as enforcement or oppression? Alternatively, what happens when therapy is only available to those with socio-economic privilege? Through a critical interrogation of the idea of the â€˜cureâ€™, this module poses a question concerning the treatment of mental health disorders and models of recovery.


The module will explore the spaces in which treatment has been situated, ranging from the asylum to the clinic, to the community. Students will be encouraged to think about the political, ethical, and economic implications of different models of â€˜cureâ€™ including psychoanalysis and psychiatry. Students will gain an understanding of the history of mental health discourse from the 19th century to the present day, as well as thinking about the current crisis in mental health provision in the UK.

This will enable you to become perceptive in terms of detail and more subtle in you understanding of the meaning of what you observe and what they themselves bring to the learning experience. It will enable you to reflect on your own process in observations and in groups and to become more self-aware. You will become more alert to first, the conscious and unconscious ways in which your capacity to observe and participate in learning is influenced by their experiences, and second, the way your own self-awareness affects your capacity to provide therapeutic attention to others.

The University makes every effort to ensure that this information on its programme specification is accurate and up-to-date. Exceptionally it can be necessary to make changes, for example to courses, facilities or fees. Examples of such reasons might include, but are not limited to: strikes, other industrial action, staff illness, severe weather, fire, civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist attack or threat of terrorist attack (whether declared or not), natural disaster, restrictions imposed by government or public authorities, epidemic or pandemic disease, failure of public utilities or transport systems or the withdrawal/reduction of funding. Changes to courses may for example consist of variations to the content and method of delivery of programmes, courses and other services, to discontinue programmes, courses and other services and to merge or combine programmes or courses. The University will endeavour to keep such changes to a minimum, and will also keep students informed appropriately by updating our
programme specifications
.Â The University would inform and engage with you if your course was to be discontinued, and would provide you with options, where appropriate, in line with our Compensation and Refund Policy.
The full Procedures, Rules and Regulations of the University governing how it operates are set out in the Charter, Statutes and
Ordinances and in the University Regulations, Policy and Procedures.
