East 15 Acting School
East 15 Acting School's MA/MFA Acting for Digital Media is a full-time, professional and intensive training program designed specifically for performers who wish to expand their skill base to be able to seek and thrive in the technological advances in the performance industry.
With the advancement of digital technology, new pathways are opening up in performing arts and the course emphasises three keys areas of training: performance capture, voice skills for digital recordings and acting for camera.
The use of Motion / Performance capture in the industry is on the rise and there is a demand for performers with specific skill sets and experience in order to excel in the area. While the standard movement and voice skills provided at UG level form a base for most all performance work, this MA/MFA focuses on understanding, working with, and making the most of new technology. This degree recognises that a performer has multiple pathways for employability and professional development, particularly looking at the role of the performer in the gaming industry.
In addition to performing for motion capture, due to advances in technology and the relatively inexpensive option of creating a home voice studio, opportunities in voice acting has also seen an increase – and also require further expertise.  Along with further training in Acting for Camera, the course will provide the training needed to succeed and shape the future of performance alongside new developments.
MA Acting for Digital Media runs for 12 months on a full-time basis and the MFA for 20 months.

The practical training gives the students the opportunities to train by working with the technology that is appropriate for the given performance; for motion capture, they will train in the University's new VICON motion capture volume, purposely designed for this programme; when working on voice acting they will work a studios and a vocal booth, with the relevant technology for a variety of disciplines such as voice over, radio drama and voicing animation; in acting for film students will take part in projects that are filmed both on-site and on location.
Our Southend Campus
is based in the heart of Southend-on-Sea. A vibrant and modern British seaside town with excellent transport links. Famous for its beach resort and pier, Southend-on-Sea stretches along seven miles of award-winning coastline. There are also over 650 acres of parks and gardens, a fun park, leisure centres, pubs, clubs, cafés and restaurants.
Southend Central railway station is opposite our Campus and the journey to central London takes less than an hour. Southend Airport, with flights to many European and UK destinations is just three miles away. We are also just one hour away from London's Stansted Airport.
Our Gateway Building houses a purpose-built suite specifically for East 15 students. This includes fully equipped, state-of-the art rehearsal studios with panoramic views across Southend-on-Sea, plus our motion capture volume, seminar rooms, computer labs and media production resources including an Apple Mac editing suite.
A magnificent Victorian former church in the heart of Southend's conservation area was converted into East 15's Clifftown Theatre.  It also houses a variety of unique spaces for rehearsals, technical and practical work and performances. The church nave, with its original organ and stained glass windows now provides an inspirational and atmospheric environment, re-designed to accommodate the needs of a twenty-first century performance space.
In ‘The Forum' building, students have round the clock, secure access to the Learning Hub, which provides innovative IT and study spaces. The Forum also houses an integrated public and academic library, carrying books and other support materials. Students in Southend also have access to the East 15 Loughton Campus library and the University's Colchester Campus library.
Outside of learning, the Students' Union at our Southend Campus provides a dedicated space for students to meet, have a coffee, relax and watch films or sport.
Your future
The MA/MFA in Acting for Digital Media is unique in that it addresses training that allows actors to thrive by understanding and tailoring performances for the form of digital capture, recognising that understanding technology and developing methodologies of rehearsal and performance in order to achieve high quality work is different from simply adapting existing technique to fit a series of parameters.

Structure
Course structure
East 15 offers dynamic and unique courses for actors, directors and students of theatre practice. Training at East 15 draws upon 50 years of tradition combined with a keen sense of today's performance industry.
This course will bring together the training needed in a coherent programme that not only allows a graduate to attain the skills necessary for this specialist work, but also to see it in a holistic context that will enable them to grow as an artist and offer a rounded contribution to the developing industry. When combined in a single programme, voice acting, acting for performance capture and acting for screen enable students to see the multiple possibilities of gearing performance for a digital format; it combines an understanding of technology, body and voice so that performances are not merely captured digitally, but specifically tailored to excel because they are created for that media.
Teaching and learning disclaimer
Following the impact of the pandemic, we made changes to our teaching and assessment to ensure our current students could continue with their studies uninterrupted and safely. These changes included courses being taught through blended delivery, normally including some face-to-face teaching, online provision, or a combination of both across the year.
The teaching and assessment methods listed show what is currently approved for 2022 entry; changes may be necessary if, by the beginning of this course, we need to adapt the way we're delivering them due to the external environment, and to allow you to continue to receive the best education possible safely and seamlessly.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options

Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.

Portfolio Project
(30 CREDITS)
This module provides the opportunity to reflect on your training, both exploring individual subjects and thinking about how the learning from your various subjects inform each other. Using skills from across the degree programme, your portfolio will be a digital record of your learning that can also be used after graduation to showcase your skills, assisting with employability. The portfolio will be both a retrospective and reflective look at their training and development and a forward-looking study that explores career and study options that are open to the student. With your portfolio supervisor you will decide on specific topic / theme that will focus the project on your personal development and career aspirations. The format for the final portfolio will be unique to each student, including a variety of written work, video footage, possibly digital art, photography, and possibly spreadsheets. While the main focus can vary, the project should address the following three categories: 1. Reflections on modular and independent learning and how these connect to your holistic development as an artist (reflection) 2. A researched plan for their progress following graduation, demonstrating a clear path towards specific career or further educational goals (progress) 3. A collection of edited material that will support the above (showcase).
