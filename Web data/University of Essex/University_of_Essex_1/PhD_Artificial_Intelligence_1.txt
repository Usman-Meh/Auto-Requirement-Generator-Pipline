We offer research supervision for our PhD Artificial Intelligence (AI) in all areas related to AI including explainable AI, generative AI, analytics and data science, natural language and information processing, games and AI future health, and technology and theoretical AI.
We provide a vibrant research environment so you can publish papers in prestigious international journals and conferences and attract the attention of industry and government.
We have an international reputation for cutting-edge interdisciplinary work combining AI, health, finance, psychology and life sciences.
Our research is geared towards practical applications, and many of our academic staff have experience applying their findings in industry and in advising the UK Government.
You can start this degree in October, January or April, either full-time or part-time. We also offer an MSD in this area.
Why we're great.
Our research covers all aspects of AI research within a School ranked sixth in Research Power in the UK Research Excellence framework for the world-leading research we are conducting.
You will join one of the largest AI research groups in the UK alongside world leaders in their domains.
We provide an active and stimulating environment to carry out your research.
Our expert staff
Studying for your PhD involves person-to-person interaction with your supervisor, who will guide you in developing your chosen research topic, refine your research skills, and advise you in capitalising on the technical knowledge you already have from your taught degree. Supervisors often keep in touch with their PhD graduates throughout their careers, and may work on scientific collaborations with you after you finish your doctorate.
You will also have access to our AI research group of world leaders in their domains, including IEEE Fellow and IET Fellows, most of whom are highly cited authors with deep expertise in their subjects.
Specialist facilities
As a PhD student, you will become a member of our
AI research group
. It encompasses five associated special interest groups:
Analytics and Data Science

Structure
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100

The
UK academic level
of the module.
A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.
A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.
A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification.

Assessment
The aim of undertaking your PhD within our School is to become trained as an independent researcher who can critically assess other research work, and have a comprehensive knowledge of their subject area.
Our PhD programme is usually three to four years duration and all our students are initially registered as MPhil/PhD students, then transferred to the PhD in the first half of their second year of study if they have made satisfactory progress. In your second and third years, you work towards your PhD.
Dissertation
Within our School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, your PhD thesis is generally completed within three to four years and has a length of around 80,000 words.
Your PhD is awarded after your successful defence of your thesis in an oral examination, in which you are interviewed about your research by two examiners, at least one of whom is from outside Essex.
