How does financial theory aid corporate decision making? How do banks manage risk across global markets?
The past 20 years have seen banks and financial markets become increasingly globalised. Deregulation and advances in technology have empowered banks to expand their offerings, making them an integral component of all financial sectors.
BSc Banking and Finance combines academic rigor with practical financial skills to meet the needs of demanding careers in banking and finance.

You explore topics including:

The first year focuses on the finance and banking area of your degree and introduces you to the main functional areas of business, including accounting, finance, management and marketing. This gives you flexibility to work in any area of finance and banking or business after graduation.
In your final year, you have the opportunity to put your knowledge into practice by completing an in-depth, independent research project or dissertation. This will give you the chance to further develop vital employability skills in areas of research, time management and critical thinking.

Changes to courses may for example consist of variations to the content and method of delivery of programmes, courses and other services, to discontinue programmes, courses and other services and to merge or combine programmes or courses. The University will endeavour to keep such changes to a minimum, and will also keep students informed appropriately by updating our
