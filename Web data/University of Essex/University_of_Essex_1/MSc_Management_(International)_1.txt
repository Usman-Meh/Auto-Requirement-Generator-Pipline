Structure
Course structure
We offer a flexible course structure with a mixture of core/compulsory modules, and optional modules chosen from lists.
Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The following modules are based on the current course structure and may change in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR

(60 CREDITS)
COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY
Management and Strategy
(20 CREDITS)
This module is designed to encourage students to reflect on a variety of issues relating to management and business strategy. It will introduce students to the basics of management such as dealing with teams, culture and organisational management structures. It will then introduce students to managing strategically, covering topics that involve the analysis of the external and internal environments of the business as well as avenues for implementation.

Consequently, the module offers an insight into a range of current business issues, management dilemmas, ethical considerations, and general governance issues relating to the strategic direction of organisations. Overall, the module provides an introduction to management and strategy and a critical examination of its application in practice.

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY
Organisational Behaviour and Human Resource Management
(20 CREDITS)
This module is designed to encourage students to think and reflect upon the nature of managing people and organisations. In particular, it encourages students to consider the main topics of Organisational Behaviour and Human Resource Management. Throughout the sessions, the core issues affecting organisational behaviour and outcomes will be discussed and critically analysed. Therefore, it invites participants to consider the tensions emerging from competing views and perspectives. In so doing, the module challenges many of the taken-for-granted assumptions about people management, and provides tools to analyse organisations and to explore the realities of organisational life.

COMPONENT 04: COMPULSORY
Accounting and Finance for Managers
(20 CREDITS)
It is essential for any manager to be able to analyse the performance of companies and take financial decisions. This module will start by examining how publicly available information can aid in analysing the performance of companies, and critically evaluating the limitations of financial performance measures. This part of the module will cover the contents of the annual report, preparation of main financial statements and evaluating the financial performance of companies based on publicly available information. The second part of the module will critically examine a range of issues that relate to financial and managerial decision-making, including cost behaviour, capital investment decisions, cost volume profit analysis and budgeting.

COMPONENT 05: COMPULSORY
Research Methods in Management
(20 CREDITS)
This module introduces students to the methodology and methods of research in the field of Management. Students are acquainted with the nature of the philosophical assumptions that underpin the choice of research design, in particular case studies for data collection and analysis. The module explores a variety of quantitative and qualitative methods to illustrate the suitability of these methods for designing research projects. The ethical, practical and legal questions raised by research are explored. Practical aspects of the research process are examined including the skills required to evaluate published research, organise and undertake a research project within the body of relevant knowledge, and make practical and actionable recommendations.

COMPONENT 06: COMPULSORY
International Management
(20 CREDITS)
Business is international in scope as managers take advantage of the comparative advantages countries around the world offer through complex and geographic dispersed value chains, not only to sell products but also to access intermediate goods, capital, knowledge and skills. This module, built around a live, practical project addresses several questions. 'How can a domestic firm internationalise its operations?' 'How are its resources and capabilities challenged and transformed by internationalisation?' 'What factors determine the success of an international business operation?' While many practical examples are provided, focus is given to developing an analytical approach to addressing these questions, drawing on two perspectives. These are the Resource-based view, which focuses on the resources and capabilities of the firm, and the Institution-based view which requires studying the differences in the business environment around the globe, to which successful companies need to adapt. The module considers political, economic and cultural difference and the strategies companies adopt when conducting business across national boundaries. Through the group project, students analyse the internationalisation of a real life organisation, identifying the purpose of internationalisation, selecting the most appropriate target market and considering the various means available to the firm to internationalise its operations. Topical issues in international business are also discussed towards the end of the module, such as the impact of Brexit on the trading relationship of the UK, the re-emergence of emerging market MNEs, 'born global' firms and the fourth industrial revolution.

COMPONENT 07: COMPULSORY
Managing Across Cultures
(20 CREDITS)
Managers increasingly find themselves working across borders calling for a thorough understanding of issues that relate to cross cultural management. In this course you enhance your understanding of the way in which globalisation and international business activities affect management and management practices across cultures.
