Computer systems can be found everywhere: inside a mobile phone, at a hospital bedside, and inside your TV, washing machine and games consoles. Computer systems engineers explore how this works – what is needed to convert machines and machinery into useful computing. We're for people who want to figure out what goes on inside the box.
Our course gives you a thorough introduction to computer science before focussing on systems engineering. You study areas including:
Writing programs, programming embedded microprocessors and designing embedded microprocessor systems in C
The design and function of modern operating systems
The functionality hardware needs to provide for an operating system
We emphasise the importance of practical learning, and you also have the opportunity to undertake a major project or product development specified either by a member of academic staff or a partner company.
In addition to these topics, you also have the flexibility to explore other areas our department specialises in, such as computer security, Big Data, and robotics.
Programming at Essex
Teaching someone to programme is about opening a door. In your first year at Essex you will study a module that introduces you to programming using C. We assess your ability to think in a programmatic way in the very first week of term and if you require additional support, we offer classes which will boost your skills and confidence with programming.

Fundamentals of Digital Systems
(15 CREDITS)
Computers, embedded systems, and digital systems in general have become an essential part of most people's lives, whether directly or indirectly. The aim of this module is to introduce the software and hardware underpinnings of such systems at an introductory yet challenging level suitable for future computer scientists and engineers. Topics covered in the module include both top-view as well as bottom-view approaches to understanding digital computers.  They range from the more theoretical (e.g., state machines, logic circuits, and von Neumann's architecture) to the more practical (e.g., how transistors produce binary signals, operating system functions, memory management, and common hardware devices).  The module also includes problem solving classes in which a guided discussion of weekly exercises is aimed at giving the student an opportunity to consolidate his/her understanding of the topics involved.  Upon completion of this module, students should have a good conceptual and practical understanding of the nature and architecture of digital computer systems and their components.

(15 CREDITS)
This module develops the fundamental concepts introduced in the Digital Systems Architecture. We examine how data are represented within digital systems, including floating point, 'text' and 'data' files, and how the conversions between internal and human-readable forms are performed. The design and applications of higher-level logic elements such as counters, registers and multiplexers are discussed, as well as the more general concept of the finite state machine and its design. Transmission of digital data between systems is introduced by examination of the RS232 protocol. Further, fundamental decisions on how such sources should be represented in digital format include sample rates and quantization accuracy are discussed. In the case of audio and video especially, the possibilities for signal processing and data compression are investigated

COMPONENT 01: CORE
Operating Systems
(15 CREDITS)
A bare computer is just a complex pile of electronics.  What a programmer needs is much higher-level: a human-usable interface; a file system; communication with other computers.  The system should be able to share itself between many users, but stop them from interfering with each other's work. It should be secure.   In short, what a bare computer needs is an operating system.   This module studies the functionality an operating system must provide, and the principles of how that is done.
View Operating Systems on our Module Directory
COMPONENT 02: CORE
C Programming and Embedded Systems
(15 CREDITS)
The overall goal of this module is to provide you with an understanding of how programs are written in C (a computer programming language) to solve engineering problems.

Changes to courses may for example consist of variations to the content and method of delivery of programmes, courses and other services, to discontinue programmes, courses and other services and to merge or combine programmes or courses. The University will endeavour to keep such changes to a minimum, and will also keep students informed appropriately by updating our
programme specifications
. The University would inform and engage with you if your course was to be discontinued, and would provide you with options, where appropriate, in line with our Compensation and Refund Policy.
The full Procedures, Rules and Regulations of the University governing how it operates are set out in the Charter, Statutes and
Ordinances and in the University Regulations, Policy and Procedures.
