The experience and findings of our experts will feature throughout your teaching. For example, you'll hear from
Dr Pawan Adhikari
, Reader in Accounting at Essex Business School. Dr Adhikari's expertise is public sector accounting, in particular highlighting the issues that emerging economies face while improving their accounting and accountability practices.
Pawan's work is widely used in policy making and his recent work in Nepal has benefitted the government, investors, development partners (for example the World Bank) and wider Nepalese society by ensuring decision-makers are truly held to account, are transparent and open to scrutiny by stakeholders. This standardisation of public sector accounting practices has been a key part of Nepal's reform agenda for the past ten years.

They organise seminars by external invited speakers, Essex Business School staff and research students; co-ordinate workshop programmes; and schedule bi-annual conferences of international renown.

Centre for Accountability and Global Development (CAGD)

Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.

Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
