One of the reasons I chose to study BSc Management and Marketing because it was a combined degree course. This has allowed me to gain knowledge in both the management and marketing fields of business. I was also impressed by the range of modules there was to choose from in third year that were very interesting as there was a mix of both management and marketing topics, meaning you could choose to go down either route or study a combination of both.

Structure
Course structure
This course allows you to specialise in the areas of both business management and marketing, as well as providing a broad overview of other important topics.
Successful completion of year zero guarantees you entry to the first year of your undergraduate degree course as well as providing you with the necessary academic skills for degree-level study.
In the first year our current students cover the fundamentals that every business manager needs to know and you will be introduced to the specialisation of marketing. However, we are planning some changes to our first year and we'll be tailoring it more closely to your chosen course. In second and final year your compulsory modules will provide a deep understanding of management and marketing, while your optional modules will allow you to follow these themes further or to explore other areas.
We offer a flexible course structure with a mixture of core/compulsory modules, and optional modules chosen from lists. Please be aware that we are planning changes to our first year to make it more relevant to your chosen course.
Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The following modules are based on the current course structure and may change in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
