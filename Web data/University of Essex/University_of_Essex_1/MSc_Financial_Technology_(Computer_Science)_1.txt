To be competitive in our modern financial industry, it is not enough for a scientist to know how to write software, nor is it enough that one can mathematically analyse markets based on simplifying assumption by ignoring the computation required.
Our MSc Financial Technology (Computer Science) course give you the understanding of the specifics and the intricacies of financial and economics markets, the ability to apply advanced computing methods and the ability to design and program solutions that successfully exploit the synergy between finance, economics, and computation.
Our course will cover areas including:
financial markets
big data analytics
blockchain
AI
python programming
Our course will give you both the theoretical and technical skills that are specific for the finance industry, as well as transferable skills such as the ability to develop and present an argument, and the ability to work independently and in groups.
The MSc Financial Technology suite of courses has three unique variants for you to explore so you can tailor your Masters in financial technology to suit your interests and goals. In addition to our MSc Financial Technology (Computer Science) course, there is also the option of
MSc Financial Technology (Finance)
and
MSc Financial Technology (Economics)
, giving you the chance to specialise in your preferred area of study.
You will work with coleagues from our
Centre for Computational Finance and Economic Agents (CCFEA)
, which is an innovative and laboratory-based teaching and research centre, with an international reputation for leading-edge, interdisciplinary work combining economic and financial modelling with computational implementation.
Postgraduate study
within CCFEA will give you rigorous training in the principles of quantitative finance and microeconomics along with computational skills.
Why we're great.
Essex has excellent research and teaching in computer science, economics, and business â€“ this course is an interdisciplinary degree benefiting from the expertise in three departments.
Study a variety of topics including microeconomics and big data, software development and the underpinnings of the financial system.
Benefit from our proximity to London as well as our connections with employers.
Our expert staff
Our course is taught in collaboration with the Centre for Computational Finance and Economic Agents (CCFEA) within the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, the Essex Finance Centre (EFiC) within Essex Business School, and the Department of Economics, all of which have an international reputation.
We bring together experts with both academic and industrial expertise in the financial and IT sectors. Our staff are currently researching the development of real-time trading platforms, new financial econometric models for real-time data, the use of artificially intelligent agents in the study of risk and market-based institutions, operational aspects of financial markets, financial engineering, portfolio and risk management, among others.
Key academic members of staff you are likely to have contact with:
Michael Kampouridis is a Senior Lecturer in Computational Finance at Essex. His main research activities are in the use of machine learning algorithms for solving real-world problems from the fields of economics and finance. He has done extensive work in algorithmic trading and financial forecasting, and also in weather derivatives.
Panagiotis Kanellopoulos is a Lecturer in Computational Finance at Essex. His research mainly focuses on algorithmic game theory, an area in the intersection of economics (game theory) and computer science (analysis of algorithms) that aims to understand and design algorithms in strategic environments, such as auctions and markets.

Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The following modules are based on the current course structure and may change in response to new curriculum developments and innovation.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course.Â A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules fromÂ which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component.Â There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100
4
FY
The department or school the module will be taught by.
In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History.
The module number.
The
UK academic level
of the module.
A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.
A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.
A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification.

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY
Introduction to Programming in Python
(20 CREDITS)
The aim of this module is to provide an introduction to computer programming for students with little or no previous experience.  The Python language is used in the Linux environment, and students are given a comprehensive introduction to both during the module.  The emphasis is on developing the practical skills necessary to write effective programs, with examples taken principally from the realm of data processing and analysis.  You will learn how to manipulate and analyse data, graph them and fit models to them.  Teaching takes place in workshop-style sessions in a software laboratory, so you can try things out as soon as you learn about them.
