Study mode:
Full-time
Duration:
1 year
Location:
Colchester Campus
Based in:
Economics
Explore the most pressing issues in international development. Analyse the impact of these issues using solid quantitative research methods. MSc Quantitative International Development is a truly interdisciplinary course in International Development, taught jointly by the
Department of Economics
,
Department of Government
,
Department of Sociology and Criminology
and
Essex Business School
. The course is open to all students looking to understand the problems that the developing world faces from the perspective of a researcher in the area.
With the new data revolution and the recent developments in data collection all over the world, we can apply strong analytical techniques to understand the reality of developing countries. Most of the cutting edge work in the best universities of the world is testing previous concepts with newly collected data using well advanced techniques. In this course we teach you the essentials of research design and statistics, and then you have the option to explore a set of selected topics in international development in order to hone your skills on the subject matter.
You build a thorough understanding of the key statistical techniques, together with a more scientific approach to understanding the pressing issues in International Development through studying the following topics:
Modern research methods
Fundamentals of research design
Econometric and Statistical techniques
Providing the opportunity to use these research skills in applications by studying topics such as:
Environmental Economics
Economic Development
Human Rights
Ethics
You are taught by leading experts in the field of international development. The Faculty of Social Sciences at Essex is top 5 in the UK for research, with over 90% of our research rated as “world-leading” or “internationally excellent”.
With this course you also have the opportunity to study abroad at one of our partner institutions and achieve a dual award, which means you'll receive two Masters degrees in two years. Find out more on our
dual award webpage.

English language requirements
If English is not your first language, we require IELTS 6.0 overall with a minimum
score of 5.5 in all components.
If you do not meet our IELTS requirements then you may be able to complete a
pre-sessional English
pathway
that enables you to start your course without retaking IELTS.
Additional Notes
The University uses academic selection criteria to determine an applicant’s ability to
successfully complete a course at the University of Essex. Where appropriate, we may ask
for specific information relating to previous modules studied or work experience.
Structure
Course structure
We offer a flexible course structure with a mixture of core/compulsory modules, and optional modules chosen from lists.
Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The course content is therefore reviewed on an annual basis to ensure our courses remain up-to-date so modules listed are subject to change.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100
4
FY
The department or school the module will be taught by.
In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History.
The module number.
The
UK academic level
of the module.
A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.
A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.
A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification.

COMPONENT 07: COMPULSORY
Advanced Quantitative Methods
(15 CREDITS)
This module presents advanced quantitative methods for political science based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), with a particular focus on the generalised linear model (GLM). After introducing the principles of MLE, models for different kinds of outcome distributions, such as binary, ordinal, categorical, count, and event history data, are considered. This module also introduces some advanced methods beyond the GLM.


All models and methods are approached substantively, mathematically, and computationally (using R), with applications to political science research questions. Throughout the module, you will also familiarise yourself with the interpretation and presentation of empirical evidence in political science. The module will be particularly useful for you if you aim to pursue a career in academia or in research-intensive environments, for example think tanks, research-related government posts, data science, or survey analytics.
