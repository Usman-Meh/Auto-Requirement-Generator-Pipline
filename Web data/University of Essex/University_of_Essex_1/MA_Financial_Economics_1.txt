Course:
Financial Economics
Start date:
October 2025
Study mode:
Full-time
Duration:
1 year
Location:
Colchester Campus
Based in:
Economics
How do investors make their decisions? How do firms arrange their finances? Our MA Financial Economics is designed for those whose first degree isn't in economics but who want to understand the financial aspects of economics in greater depth.
Are you particularly interested in the financial aspects of economics? Do you want answers to questions such as, what drives stock prices? How should assets be allocated among a portfolio of possible investments? How do international financial markets work?  Is it true that they suffer from systemic risk? If so, welcome home.
At Essex we push the frontiers of accepted wisdom, critically examining the decisions of individuals, the strategies of firms, and the policies of governments to understand and challenge the standard paradigms of economics. On this course, you build a thorough understanding of the key areas of economics, oriented towards the economics of financial markets.
So, if you want to specialise in financial economics, your first degree isn't in economics, or your previous economics training doesn't suit our MSc courses, our MA Financial Economics may be for you.
There's always something fascinating going on in our department, from regular lively debates with prestigious speakers in seminars, workshops and conferences to
cutting-edge papers
being published in leading journals, including American Economic Review, Econometrica, and Review of Economic Studies.
Why we're great.
We are 4th in UK for research power in economics and econometrics (Times Higher Education research power measure, Research Excellence Framework 2021).
The Department of Economics at Essex is home to staff and students from all over the world who have a strong sense of belonging and want to think, learn and achieve together.
Stand out from the crowd for a career in business and finance with a desirable understanding of economic reasoning.

English language requirements
If English is not your first language, we require IELTS 6.0 overall with a minimum
score of 5.5 in all components.
If you do not meet our IELTS requirements then you may be able to complete a
pre-sessional English
pathway
that enables you to start your course without retaking IELTS.
Additional Notes
The University uses academic selection criteria to determine an applicant’s ability to
successfully complete a course at the University of Essex. Where appropriate, we may ask
for specific information relating to previous modules studied or work experience.
Structure
Course structure
We offer a flexible course structure with a mixture of core/compulsory modules, and optional modules chosen from lists.
Our research-led teaching is continually evolving to address the latest challenges and breakthroughs in the field. The course content is therefore reviewed on an annual basis to ensure our courses remain up-to-date so modules listed are subject to change.
We understand that deciding where and what to study is a very important decision for you. We'll make all reasonable efforts to provide you with the courses, services and facilities as described on our website and in line with your contract with us. However, if we need to make material changes, for example due to significant disruption, we'll let our applicants and students know as soon as possible.
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.
Status
What this means
Core
You must take the set module for this component and you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Core with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component but you must pass. No failure can be permitted.
Compulsory
You must take the set module for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Compulsory with Options
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
Optional
You can choose which module to study from the available options for this component. There may be limited opportunities to continue on the course/be eligible for the qualification if you fail.
The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
module code
. For example, the module code HR100-4-FY means:
HR
100
4
FY
The department or school the module will be taught by.
In this example, the module would be taught by the Department of History.
The module number.
The
UK academic level
of the module.
A standard undergraduate course will comprise of level 4, 5 and 6 modules - increasing as you progress through the course.
A standard postgraduate taught course will comprise of level 7 modules.
A postgraduate research degree is a level 8 qualification.

COMPONENT 02: COMPULSORY
Introductory Macroeconomics
(20 CREDITS)
Introductory Macroeconomics studies some of the fundamental concepts and methods in economics. It equips you with the basic tools and methods of analysis used in economic reasoning. You are introduced to National income accounting, the basics of fiscal and monetary policies in the short run, and the critical role of the Government's budget constraint.

The module then progresses into a discussion of the trade-off between inflation and unemployment and the role of the natural rate of unemployment. Particular emphasis is applied to understanding how macroeconomics can help understanding the economic environment we live in and the most important economic challenges we face.

COMPONENT 03: COMPULSORY
Introductory Microeconomics
(20 CREDITS)
Microeconomics studies the economic behaviour of individual economic decision makers such as consumers, workers, firms, or managers. You will be looking at decision-making and markets when all agents have perfect information about goods and prices and individual agents cannot affect prices through their own actions. Later in the module you will turn to the concept of market equilibrium with more detailed understanding of demand and supply in order to derive properties of market behaviour.

COMPONENT 04: COMPULSORY
Introductory Econometrics
(20 CREDITS)
This module provides an introduction to the econometric methods commonly used to analyse economic data and the application of these methods. The focus of the module is on linear regression and the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation procedure. This is introduced after a review of basic probability, random variables, simple descriptive statistics and the concept of the null hypothesis.
