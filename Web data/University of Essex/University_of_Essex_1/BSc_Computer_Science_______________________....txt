Our BSc Computer Science (including Foundation Year) could be suitable for you if your academic qualifications do not yet meet our entry requirements for a three-year version of our computer science, electronic engineering and mathematics courses and you want a programme that improves your skills to support your academic performance.
Open to UK and EU applicants, this four-year course includes a Foundation Year (known as Year Zero) which is delivered by our
Essex Pathways Department
followed by a further three years of study in our
School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering.
During Year Zero you will study on our
Computer Science, Electronic Engineering and Mathematics Pathway
which will cover topics such as statistical analysis and modelling, and computer programming. At the end of Year Zero all students who pass the Computer Science, Electronic Engineering and Mathematics Pathway will have a choice of which course to progress with. As well as BSc Computer Science, students on the Computer Science, Electronic Engineering and Mathematics Pathway could also study BSc Computer Games, BSc Mathematics or BEng Electronic Engineering.
From Year One of BSc Computer Science you will choose from a wide choice of optional modules and specialise in areas as diverse as assistive technologies, computer games, artificial intelligence, evolutionary computation, Big Data and robotics. If you have a good ability to think in a computational way, you'll be perfect for our course.
You also acquire key skills for computer science in the areas of:
Algorithm analysis and basic computability
Software engineering
Java language principles and application programming interfaces
That's why we are ranked 6th in the UK for research power in computer science (Times Higher Education research power measure, Research Excellence Framework 2021).
Programming at Essex
Teaching someone to programme is about opening a door. In Year 1 at Essex you will study a module that introduces you to programming using Python. We assess your ability to think in a programmatic way in the very first week of term and if you require additional support, we offer classes which will boost your skills and confidence with programming.
Why we're great.
We equip you with the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed at Essex and beyond.

"I graduated from Essex with a BSc Computer Science degree and am currently working as a Site Reliability Engineer for Google. My focus is on Google’s API gateway software, which is also used on Google Cloud. My experience at Essex helped tremendously in enabling me to get to where I am now. Every day I make use of the skills I gained during my studies, not to mention the practical experience I received. My placement year at Rolls-Royce was a fantastic and invaluable opportunity, which allowed me to develop control software for the Trent 7000 engine. Aircraft with this engine are probably in the air even now!"

Changes to courses may for example consist of variations to the content and method of delivery of programmes, courses and other services, to discontinue programmes, courses and other services and to merge or combine programmes or courses. The University will endeavour to keep such changes to a minimum, and will also keep students informed appropriately by updating our
programme specifications
. The University would inform and engage with you if your course was to be discontinued, and would provide you with options, where appropriate, in line with our Compensation and Refund Policy.
The full Procedures, Rules and Regulations of the University governing how it operates are set out in the Charter, Statutes and
Ordinances and in the University Regulations, Policy and Procedures.
