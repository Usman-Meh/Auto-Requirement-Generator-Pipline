In one of the world's most global industries, employers are looking for creativity, confidence and passion from the next generation of hospitality leaders.
The growth of the worldwide hospitality industry has been dominated by American and, to a lesser extent, Western European multinational brands. However, the last decade has seen a significant increase in the emergence and growth of successful hospitality organisations from a range of emerging nations and cultures from across the world. This programme is designed to reflect the increasing cultural and geographical diversity of the hospitality industry.
As a global industry, the hospitality sector is driven by human connection and personalisation, relying on the experiences its workforce can deliver and the memories its customers create. To be a leader in the hospitality or events sector you'll need the creativity to think outside of the norm and the confidence to manage everything thrown at you in an industry where no two days are the same.
With the MSc International Hospitality Management, these two strands are intertwined. This programme combines a deeper understanding of the hospitality sector with the skills and knowledge of successful management.
Why we're great.
Learn from a dedicated team of experts with decades of experience in hospitality, events and management.
The first hotel school of its kind in the UK to with a fully commercial 4* hotel on campus.
Create a wide-ranging network of professional contacts to create exciting opportunities and bolster your career prospects.

There will be opportunities throughout the Masters to meet industry leaders and managers, allowing you to build a comprehensive network of hospitality and business professionals.
"Our Masters course connects you with our extensive network of industry professionals, equipping you with the skills, contacts and knowledge to succeed in the global hospitality industry" - Andrew Boer, Principal of the Edge Hotel School.

Structure
Components and modules explained
Components
Components are the blocks of study that make up your course. A component may have a set module which you must study, or a number of modules from which you can choose.
Each component has a status and carries a certain number of credits towards your qualification.

The modules that are available for you to choose for each component will depend on several factors, including which modules you have chosen for other components, which modules you have completed in previous years of your course, and which term the module is taught in.
Modules
Modules are the individual units of study for your course. Each module has its own set of learning outcomes and assessment criteria and also carries a certain number of credits.
In most cases you will study one module per component, but in some cases you may need to study more than one module. For example, a 30-credit component may comprise of either one 30-credit module, or two 15-credit modules, depending on the options available.
Modules may be taught at different times of the year and by a different department or school to the one your course is primarily based in. You can find this information from the
