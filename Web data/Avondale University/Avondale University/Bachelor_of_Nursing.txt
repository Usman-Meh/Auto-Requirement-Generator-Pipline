Practical Experience
Clinical placements commence in Semester two for full time first-year Bachelor of Nursing students, provided students complete the pre-requisite Level 1 units and meet pre-clinical requirements. All clinical placements are mandatory, with 100% attendance required. The content of each clinical unit is related to the areas being studied in corresponding theoretical units. Clinical placements are organised for students and provided in cooperation with the Sydney Adventist Hospital, and many other placements available in local and regional hospitals, specialist mental health facilities, paediatric units, and at aged care and community facilities.
Students are expected to attend clinical placements on rotating shifts (morning, afternoon, and night) and travel to and from placement sites. Most clinical placement sites are within Sydney, Central Coast and Hunter New England areas. In addition, students may have the opportunity to attend a rural or remote placement.
Clinical placements are of two to four weeks duration, with the course requiring the completion of a total of 800 hours of placement throughout the degree.
The following units include clinical placements:
NURS11102 Nursing Practice 2 - 80 hours
NURS22203 Nursing Practice 3 - 80 hours
NURS22205 Nursing the Older Person - 80 hours
NURS22207 Mental Health Nursing Practice - 80 hours
NURS22204 Nursing Practice 4 - 80 hours
NURS33303 Clinical Nursing Elective - 80 hours
NURS33305 Nursing Practice 5 - 80 hours
NURS33306 Nursing Practice 6 - 80 hours
NURS33308 Transition to Professional Practice - 160 hours
To participate in clinical placements, students will need to meet requirements regarding vaccinations, criminal record and working with children checks, and first aid certification. Refer to Post Admission Requirements for further details.
Post Admission Requirements
To be eligible to attend clinical placements, students must meet a range of requirements including:
Vaccinations in accordance with NSW Health policy
National Criminal Record Check (NCRC)
First aid Certificate
Working with Children Check
NDIS Workers Screening Check
NSW Health Compulsory Compliance Day
NSW Health will verify and record students' compliance in ClinConnect (a web-based application for managing clinical placements) before the commencement of their first clinical placement. The NSW Health Compulsory Compliance Day is included in the semester timetables.
Vaccinations
NSW Health requires that all students enrolled in clinical placements in NSW Public Health Facilities comply with NSW Health policies, in particular the
Occupational Assessment, Screening and Vaccination Against Specified Infectious Diseases
and
Student Placements in NSW Health
. This includes mandatory NSW Health COVID-19 vaccination requirements and annual influenza vaccinations.
Nursing students will be supplied with a 'NSW Health Vaccination Record Card for Health Care Workers and Students’ to provide evidence of immunisations. A medical practitioner (i.e., doctor, nurse, or vaccination provider) must complete the student’s vaccination record card, and each entry must be certified (i.e. clinic/practice stamp, full name, and signature).
We recommend that students print their Medicare vaccination history statement to use as evidence of vaccinations, if available.
It is important to satisfy the vaccination requirements early, therefore, students are encouraged to start this process as soon as possible after acceptance into the Bachelor of Nursing course, as some vaccinations take several months to complete.
