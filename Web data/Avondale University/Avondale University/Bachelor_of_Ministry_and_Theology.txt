Bachelor of Ministry and Theology
Why study with us?
The Bachelor of Ministry and Theology (BMinTh) is an undergraduate program designed for those who have felt the call of God to be ministers of the Gospel. The BMinTh is designed to prepare students to serve as ministers in the church and wider community. Students study units in church ministry, theology, and biblical studies, with an optional major in chaplaincy, extending career opportunities.
The BMinTh integrates deep Biblical knowledge with practical experience to equip men and women with the knowledge and skills needed to build a strong church and community and strengthen ministry networks and contacts. Practical experience opportunities include church placements and externship experiences.
The BMinTh can be studied on campus or online providing students with the flexibility to balance study with work and family commitments.
Avondale is an institutional member of the Australian and New Zealand Association of Theological Studies Limited (ANZATS) and the Australian and New Zealand Association of Theological Field Educators (ANZATFE).

Practical Experience
All Church Ministry (CHMN) coded units are associated with a form of work integrated learning, which in theological circles is referred to as supervised field education. Field education is an apprenticeship whereby ministry students are teamed with pastors who supervise, support and mentor the student throughout ministry placements which can occur in various settings. Supervising trainee pastors in real-world settings is central to ministry formation. It allows students to integrate theological content with practical ministry and provides students with the opportunity to experience ministry in various circumstances. Field education also enables students to develop a deeper knowledge of their spiritual gifts, strengths, and weaknesses.
Students experience two types of supervised field education:
Placements: Students are on placement for 4 hours/week for 10 consecutive weeks in an approved ministry placement.
Externships: Students are immersed in an evangelistic context for 10 consecutive days, inclusive of two weekends.
Students are supported throughout their field education experience.

Professional Registration
Seventh-day Adventist graduates of the BMinTh are eligible to begin a ministry internship in a local conference. After two years of internship, their progress is reviewed to determine if they are ready for a ministerial or commissioned licence. A further three or more years of satisfactory ministry practice is necessary before they can be considered for ordination or commissioning and a full ministerial / commissioned credential is issued.
Other graduates of the BMinTh should liaise with officers of their own denomination to determine the ministry requirements that apply to them.
