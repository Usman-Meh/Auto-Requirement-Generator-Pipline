Undergraduate Certificate in Science
Why study with us?
The Undergraduate Certificate in Science is a pathway into science focused university degrees. This course centres around biology, chemistry, physics and environmental issues and gives students the flexibility to structure their studies around personal areas of interest. Through field work, industry experience and laboratory programs, students can expand their knowledge and develop technical skills.
As a tertiary pathway, this certificate can lead into our Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Teaching and Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Teaching programs.
