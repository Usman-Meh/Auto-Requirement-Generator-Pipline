Core Discipline Studies
Core Discipline Studies units are non-teacher education units that focus on the development of content knowledge across, health, families, communities, numeracy and science. These areas constitute core background knowledge that early childhood education and care educators can apply to their future role as educational leaders and administrators of children, families and their communities. All of these units promote reflective practice and encourage students to re-negotiate their stories of self. These units, together with the 4 specialisation units are undertaken in the first year of the course.
Curriculum Studies
Focus on the development of practices and processes of teaching the play based, socially just and inclusive early childhood curriculum and primary school curriculum. They also allow the pre-service educator to develop familiarity with curriculum framework documents for Australian early childhood settings and syllabus documents for the Australian Curriculum and NSW School System.
Education Studies
Provide a theoretical base to the teaching and learning process
Professional Development and Curriculum & Pedagogical Studies
Address the strategies, skills and practices involved in teaching in an early childhood setting and primary school setting. They provide opportunities for continued professional experience, offering increasing responsibility within a variety of settings in both prior to school and primary school.
Rules of progression
Normally students complete 100 and 200 level units before progressing to higher units.
All units in semester 1 & 2 of the first year of the course, must have been completed successfully before a student can enroll in any Curriculum Studies, Professional Development or Curriculum and Pedagogical Studies units.

Practical Experience
Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Teaching (Birth – 12 years) Placements
Professional experience placement requirements total 115 days (55 days in early childhood education and care and 60 days in a school setting).
The goal of professional experience in the workplace is to prepare teacher education students to take charge of the classroom and cope with the demands of teaching early childhood education and care contexts and primary school contexts. Placements provide opportunities for teacher education students to:
Experience the teaching role in a variety of settings;
Observe links between theory and practice;
Apply knowledge to practice at regular intervals during their course;
Work towards achieving the Graduate Teaching Standards in the Professional Knowledge, Professional Practice and Professional Engagement domains.
While there is a common approach to professional placements, the scope is appropriate to specific courses. We expect students to demonstrate their proficiency based on the particular outcomes relevant to their study. This means they can:
Maintain satisfactory academic progression before professional experience placement;
Act in a way that demonstrates sound cognitive, mental, emotional and physical health, and be able to cope with the varying demands of classroom situations;
Demonstrate the ability to cope effectively with stressful situations;
Demonstrate the ability to maintain a duty of care while on placement;
Relate to students in an age-appropriate and professional manner;
Model appropriate literacy and numeracy skills in the classroom and beyond.
We do not permit students who cannot demonstrate their fitness for teaching on placement.
Professional experience placements occur throughout all teaching programs, as per the course structure.  It is the student’s responsibility to be available at those times.
Pre-service teachers will experience a range of placement settings in private and community-based childcare services, public and independent schools, and one rural/regional school. Students are responsible for placement-related expenses, including accommodation and transport and other related costs.
Professional Registration
Endorsement of Avondale University’s Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Teaching (Birth – 12 years) by the New South Wales Government Institute of Teachers Advisory Panel (NESA) qualifies graduates for employment as teachers in NSW schools. Other Australian state governments have different requirements for teachers to become registered to teach in their state. Before practising in the classroom, you must register for accreditation with the relevant state professional teaching body.
Information concerning certification requirements is available from the Professional Experience Coordinator. It would be best to familiarise yourself with the requirements, as responsibility for teacher registration rests with you.
English Language Proficiency Requirements for Teachers in NSW
International students may require an International English Language Test Score (IELTS), or equivalent, of at least 7 in reading and writing and 8 in speaking and listening for teacher registration if part of their qualifications are from a country where English is not the primary language.
Career Opportunities
BA/BTch (Birth - 12 years) graduates leave with the skills to gain employment in the following areas:
Early Childhood teacher
Primary school teacher (Prep or Kindergarten to Year 6)
Preschool teacher
Day care centre educational leader or nominated supervisor (after one year of teaching)
Family day care coordinator
Graduates leave qualified to teach in the prior to school settings for birth - 5 years and in independent and state school systems in both Australia and overseas. In addition to education-related careers, teachers often find careers in the corporate world where organisational and relationship skills are valued by employers.
