Practical Experience
Students engage in a one-day per week clinical placement over the course of their final year of study. They will participate in the activities of a counselling organisation, including conducting counselling sessions, keeping clinical records, and providing referrals. The clinical placement brings together theoretical learning and skills practice and provides valuable industry experience.
Post Admission Requirements
Working with Children Check (WWCC)
Students will need to obtain a New South Wales Working with Children Check, as well as the equivalent Working with Children Check in any state or territory in which they intend to complete a professional placement. A Working with Children Check needs to be obtained before commencing a professional placement.
Students can apply for a Working with Children Check online through the Office of the Children's Guardian. After the application is complete, the application number and the expiry date must be emailed to the Counselling Placement Coordinator.

Screening Interview
Current Psychotherapy and Counselling Federation of Australia (PACFA) requirements include that students must undergo a screening interview, which will take place in the second year of the course.
Professional Registration
Graduates obtain registration as a Counsellor with the Psychotherapy and Counselling Federation of Australia (PACFA).
If the student’s intended goal is to work towards registration as a Psychologist in Australia, the student must enrol in the Combined Specialisation in Counselling & Psychology (Dual Specialisation) and in addition complete postgraduate study. Completion of the Bachelor of Arts (Counselling) Dual Specialisation will not automatically lead to registration as a Psychologist but does fulfil the undergraduate requirements of the Australian Psychology Accreditation Council. This will allow the student (subject to meeting postgraduate entry requirements) to continue into postgraduate study and thus work towards registration as a Psychologist in Australia.
Career Opportunities
Bachelor of Arts (Counselling) graduates will be equipped to work within both private and public sectors. This course provides our graduates with the confidence and knowledge to apply a range of counselling approaches with their clients. Graduates are also eligible for membership in the Psychotherapy and Counselling Federation of Australia (PACFA).
Bachelor of Arts (Counselling) graduates develop skills for the following roles:
Counsellor
Marriage Counsellor
Family Therapist
School Counsellor
Welfare and Youth Counsellor
Telephone Counsellor
