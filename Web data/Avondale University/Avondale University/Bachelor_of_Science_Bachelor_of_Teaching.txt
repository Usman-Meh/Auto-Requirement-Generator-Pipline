Practical Experience
Students need to do 80 days of professional Experience in schools over four sessions.
Professional Experience is a critical component of initial teacher education and offers pre-service teachers enrolled in teaching degrees work-integrated learning opportunities as part of their professional development. Avondale's Professional Experience program is based on a framework of high-quality Professional Experience in Australian schools to provide high-quality experiences that will equip pre-service teachers to face the challenges and diversity of classrooms. All mentor teachers for domestic Professional Experience placements are registered teachers at the Proficient level or higher of the Australian Institute of Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) standards.
Professional Experience placements occur regularly throughout all teaching degree programs at times listed in the course structure.  It is the student's responsibility to be available at those times. Pre-service teachers may experience a range of school settings, including public and independent schools and one rural/regional school. Each school placement offers pre-service teachers the opportunity to apply their theoretical learning to real-life situations.
The student's responsibility is to transport to and from placement schools and accommodation and related costs.
In addition to the listed admission criteria, students will need the relevant Working With Children Check applicable to any Australian state where they choose to complete a placement. A supervised overseas placement may be allowable for one placement other than the final placement.
Students also need to be able to demonstrate their fitness for teaching. This means they can:
maintain satisfactory academic progression before professional experience placement;
act in a way that demonstrates sound cognitive, mental, emotional and physical health, and be able to cope with the varying demands of classroom situations;
demonstrate the ability to cope effectively with stressful situations;
demonstrate the ability to maintain a duty of care while on placement;
relate to students in an age-appropriate and professional manner;
be able to model appropriate literacy and numeracy skills in the classroom and beyond.
Students who cannot demonstrate their fitness for teaching will not be allowed to do school placements.
Professional Registration
At the completion of the course students must be accredited with the state professional teaching body before practising in the classroom. In NSW it is New South Wales Education Standards Authority (NESA).
