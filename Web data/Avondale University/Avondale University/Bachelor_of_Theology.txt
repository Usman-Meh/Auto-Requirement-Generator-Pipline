Bachelor of Theology
Why study with us?
The Bachelor of Theology (BTheol) is an undergraduate program which enables students to study the theological disciplines for either personal interest, or as a preparation for postgraduate study and a possible academic career in theology. The course covers areas such as biblical studies, biblical languages, theology, and Christian history.
The BTheol will prepare students for work in a range of not-for-profit, church, government, and private organisations. With strong church contacts and one-on-one support, students will be work-ready upon graduation. However, this degree does not prepare students for work as a pastor. Those interested in pastoral ministry should consider enrolment in the Bachelor of Ministry and Theology.
Avondale is an institutional member of the Australia/New Zealand Association of Theological Studies Limited (ANZATS) and the Australian and New Zealand Association of Theological Field Educators (ANZATFE).
