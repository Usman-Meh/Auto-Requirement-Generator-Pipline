Graduate Certificate in Counselling
Why study with us?
The Graduate Certificate in Counselling is an introduction to the essential skills and theories used in the Counselling profession. Within the context of a Christian worldview, this course builds foundational counselling skills and introduces various counselling methods. Graduate Certificate in Counselling graduates will gain enhanced people skills as well as insights into human behaviour and common emotional disorders.
With the ability to choose an elective, the Graduate Certificate is a flexible introduction to counselling and a pathway to becoming a qualified Counsellor. It is designed for those with a bachelor’s degree in any discipline who seek a career change.
