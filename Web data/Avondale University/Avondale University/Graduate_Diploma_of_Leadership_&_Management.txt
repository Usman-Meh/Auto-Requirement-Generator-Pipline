Graduate Diploma of Leadership and Management
Why study with us?
The Graduate Diploma of Leadership and Management (GDLM) course provides an opportunity for those in leadership and management positions to further their study in this area with the context of a Christian framework. The challenge of leadership and management in various types of organisations has become more demanding and complex.
Adapting to rapidly changing business environments calls for a more sophisticated set of skills and abilities from leaders and managers. All organisations, including faith-based and not-for-profit, require effective leadership informed by the social sciences and a developing body of knowledge, concerning management, leadership, and organisations.
The GDLM focusses on providing advanced training in management theory and practice, emphasising the ethical, moral, and faith-based values of leadership and management.
The Graduate Diploma is also a pathway into the Avondale Master of Business Administration program.
