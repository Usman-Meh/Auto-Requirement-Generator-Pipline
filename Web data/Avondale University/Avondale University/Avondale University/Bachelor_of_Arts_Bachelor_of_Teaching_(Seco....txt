Practical Experience
Students have regular opportunities to practice their developing teaching skills in the classroom through Professional Experience Placements. For students in an undergraduate degree this is a minimum of 80 days. This provides opportunities to develop essential mastery of the Graduate Teaching Standards, required by the Australian Institute of Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) prior to graduation.
It is important that teacher education students:
Be available during regularly scheduled Professional Experience Placements, refraining from booking other events during this time
Be willing to experience a variety of school contexts
Take responsibility for any transport or accommodation costs associated with their Professional Experience Placement
Students must provide evidence of compliance on arrival at each school for their Professional Experience Placement. Evidence includes:
Working With Children Check
Child Protection Awareness Training and annual updates
ASCIA anaphylaxis e-training
NSW Department of Education Code of Conduct
If students become ineligible to visit schools for Professional Experience Placements or are barred from attending at a school for any reason, they will not be able to complete this degree.
Fitness for Teaching
Students need to demonstrate their fitness for teaching to complete a Professional Experience Placement. This means being able to:
Maintain satisfactory academic progression before Professional Experience Placement
Act in a way that demonstrates sound cognitive, mental, emotional and physical health, and be able to cope with the varying demands of classroom situations
Demonstrate the ability to cope effectively with stressful situations
Demonstrate the ability to maintain a duty of care while on Professional Experience Placement
Relate to students in an age-appropriate and professional manner
Be able to model appropriate literacy and numeracy skills in the classroom and beyond.
Conflicts of Interest
Teacher education students should seek Professional Experience Placements in schools where no relatives or friends are working or attending. This is to avoid a conflict of interest in mentoring and assessing teacher education students. Otherwise, any relationship must be disclosed, with Avondale reserving the right to make a decision regarding the Professional Experience Placement. Failure to disclose this information may mean that the grade for the Professional Experience Placement is subject to revision or annulment. Students cannot complete a placement at a school where they are a present or past employee.
Post Admission Requirements
Working with Children Check (WWCC)
Students will need to obtain a New South Wales Working with Children Check, as well as the equivalent Working with Children Check in any state or territory in which they intend to complete a Professional Experience Placement. Students enrolled in an initial teacher education degree will need to have obtained an NSW WWCC no later than the end of their first year.
Students need to apply for a Working with Children Check online through the Office of the Children's Guardian. After the application is complete, the application number and the expiry date must be emailed to the Professional Experience Placement Officer.
E:
edu.placements@avondale.edu.au
Child Protection Awareness Training
Students are required to complete the Child Protection Awareness Training within the first two weeks of the semester, before the first Professional Experience Placement. The training is a self-paced online e-learning course available through the NSW Department of Education. Students should save their evidence of completion as a PDF file and email it to the Professional Experience Placement Officer. E: edu.placements@avondale.edu.au.
Child Protection Update
When a student has completed the Child Protection Awareness training, they must register for MyPL, and then complete Child Protection Updates annually.
The specific focus of the annual Child Protection Update varies each year, depending on current needs as identified by the NSW Department of Education. The aim of the course is to provide a general refresher on recognising and responding to suspected risk of harm across a range of categories. It reminds those working in an education context of the actions to take when identifying and responding to students at risk of harm.
ASCIA anaphylaxis e-training
The NSW Department of Education mandates that students receive anaphylaxis management training before commencing their first Professional Experience Placement. Students are required to complete ASCIA anaphylaxis e-training for Australian schools.
Once completed, please print, scan, and email the certificate(s) to the Professional Experience Placement Officer.
E:
edu.placements@avondale.edu.au
National Literacy and Numeracy Test (LANTITE)
Government requirements stipulate that students must pass the Government
Literacy and Numeracy Test
(LANTITE) in order to commence their final Professional Experience Placement. It is advised that students sit this test in the first year of their course. The booking of and the payment for these tests is the responsibility of each student, being separate to tuition fees.
The Placement Officer is available to assist students with all post admission requirements and can be contacted at:
E:
edu.placements@avondale.edu.au
T:
02 4980 2180
Professional Registration
At the completion of the course, students must register with the state professional teaching body before they are eligible to teach in a school. In New South Wales this accrediting body is the New South Wales Education Standards Authority (NESA).
