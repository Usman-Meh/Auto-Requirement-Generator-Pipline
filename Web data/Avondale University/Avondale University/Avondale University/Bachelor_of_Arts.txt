Bachelor of Arts
Why study with us?
The Bachelor of Arts (BA) is designed to present the humanities and creative arts within a Christian world view. The course encourages students to explore and challenge their view of the world, society, and self.
Students can choose to study within a range of creative and/or visual arts, and humanitarian areas. Studying a BA provides opportunities to develop abilities in problem-recognition and solving, research skills, analysis, synthesis and creativity, critical and reflective thinking, and written and non-verbal communication.
The BA provides broad preparation for employment, as well as a sound basis for those wishing to pursue postgraduate qualifications.
