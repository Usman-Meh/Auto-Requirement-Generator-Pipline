Graduate Certificate in Lifestyle Medicine
Why study with us?
The Graduate Certificate in Lifestyle Medicine empowers students to recognise and promote effective lifestyle-based therapies to prevent, manage and, in some instances, even reverse chronic diseases.
The Graduate Certificate in Lifestyle Medicine is a flexible course giving students the opportunity to structure their studies around their areas of interest. For individuals with existing healthcare qualifications, it is also a pathway into the Master of Lifestyle Medicine. Major areas of study include an examination of the history of disease and the rationale for Lifestyle Medicine, core Lifestyle Medicine pillars, the pivotal roles of nutrition and physical activity, underlying physiological factors in chronic disease, psychological influences, environmental factors, substance use (focus on nicotine), the processes used to administer Lifestyle Medicine, cultural factors that influence Lifestyle Medicine interventions, and more.
The course is recognised by the
Australasian Society of Lifestyle Medicine
as a pathway to becoming a Fellow of the Society.
