Why study with us?
The Master of Education (MEd) builds a student’s capacity for Christ-centred practice with critically informed knowledge and work integrated learning. The course aims to inspire and empower Christian teachers to serve God with excellence in education, in the context of spirituality, wellbeing, integrity and service.
The MEd program has four specialisation options as follows, or may be undertaken without a specialisation:
Leadership & Administration
Special & Inclusive Education
Curriculum & Teaching
Health & Wellbeing
All units in the MEd are offered online with an annual on campus component (Winter School) held on the Lake Macquarie campus for one week (5 days) during July.  Attendance at Winter school is strongly recommended. Online attendance is available where circumstances make it difficult to attend in person.
MEd units are recognised as accredited Professional Development with all Australian State Accreditation Authorities, contributing 50 hours each of elective professional development to the maintenance period in which they are completed.

"Specialising in well-being for my Master of Education program has been a wonderful experience, equipping me to adapt to the ever-changing classroom. It's not easy going back to study after many years of working, but despite the challenges, the journey has been incredibly worthwhile. Avondale's staff and professors go above and beyond, providing constant support and valuable guidance every step of the way."
