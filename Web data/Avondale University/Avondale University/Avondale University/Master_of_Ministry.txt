The MMin integrates deep Biblical knowledge with practical experience to equip men and women with the knowledge and skills needed to build a strong church and community and strengthen ministry networks and contacts. Practical experience opportunities include church placements and an externship.
The MMin can be studied on campus or online providing students with the flexibility to balance study with work and family commitments.

Practical Experience
All Church Ministry (CHMN) coded units are associated with a form of work integrated learning, which in theological circles is referred to as supervised field education. Field education is an apprenticeship whereby ministry students are teamed with pastors who supervise, support and mentor the student throughout ministry placements which can occur in various settings. Supervising trainee pastors in real-world settings is central to ministry formation. It allows students to integrate theological content with practical ministry and provides students with the opportunity to experience ministry in various circumstances. Field education also enables students to develop a deeper knowledge of their spiritual gifts, strengths, and weaknesses.
Students experience two types of supervised field education:
1. Placements: Students are on placement for 4 hours/week for 10 consecutive weeks in a local church or school under the supervision of a pastoral mentor.
2. Externships: Students are immersed in an evangelistic context for 10 consecutive days, inclusive of two weekends.
Students are supported throughout their field education experience.

Post Admission Requirements
An AdSafe Certificate of Completion for Safe Churches must be obtained prior to Church Placement. Students will complete the training for this certificate online. Additional in-person AdSafe training is provided as part of the course.
Professional Registration
Seventh-day Adventist graduates of the MMin are eligible to begin a ministry internship in a local conference. After two years of internship, their progress is reviewed to determine if they are ready for a ministerial or commissioned licence. A further three or more years of satisfactory ministry practice is necessary before they can be considered for ordination or commissioning and a full ministerial / commissioned credential is issued.
Other graduates of the MMin should liaise with officers of their own denomination to determine the ministry requirements that apply to them.
Career Opportunities
The Master of Ministry (MMin) allows students to meet the changing needs of churches in our society today. Men and women with a Master of Ministry will be equipped to serve as a:
Church Pastor
Youth Pastor
Pastoral Educator
Evangelist
Church Planter
The MMin fulfills the Master’s level pre-requisite required for those wishing to complete a Doctorate in Ministry.
