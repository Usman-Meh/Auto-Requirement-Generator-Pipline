Graduate Diploma in Counselling
Why study with us?
The Graduate Diploma in Counselling is a 96 credit point course delivered at AQF Level 8, divided over 16 units (15 counselling units and one religious studies unit to meet Avondale's requirements as a Christian College of Higher Education). It provides students with both the experiential and theoretical foundation to function as professional counsellors in Australia. Posited in a Christian worldview, this supportive, two-year course emphasises the common factors essential to counselling, introduces various counselling methods, and builds basic and advanced counselling skills. The Graduate Diploma in Counselling also introduces students to research in the science of counselling and provides a one-year clinical placement. An application for accreditation of the course with the Psychotherapy and Counselling Federation of Australia (PACFA) is planned as the course is designed to meet the requirements of PACFA but it should be noted that accreditation is not yet in place given the recency of the course commencement.
