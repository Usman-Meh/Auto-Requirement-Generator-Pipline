Master of Philosophy
Why study with us?
The Master of Philosophy (MPhil) is an internationally-recognised degree that enables candidates to apply an advanced body of knowledge in a range of contexts for research and scholarship. The MPhil degree may also be completed as a pathway for enrolment in a PhD.
Delivered within a Christian education framework, the MPhil also enables candidates to develop an understanding of ethical scholarship principles that are conducive to conducting research in Christian organisations.
MPhil candidates receive support by meeting regularly with their supervisors (online and on-campus) and attending research training sessions. The candidate and appointed supervisors negotiate the necessary workload commitments required by the candidate to complete the degree requirements within the stated timeframes.
On average, a full-time study load would require 28-40 hours of study per week, whereas a part-time study load would require 14-20 hours of study per week.
In the final semester, the candidate submits a thesis of 40,000-50,000 words (or equivalent exegesis).
