See our program philosophy
The Bridge to Canadian Nursing (BCN) program at Mount Royal University provides a supportive educational environment for internationally educated nurses to build confidence and competence as they transition into the Canadian healthcare system.
The program helps “bridge” the differences between previous nursing experience and practice in Canada in areas such as professional communication skills, health alterations and therapeutics, health assessment, professional nursing skills, nursing clinical practice in a medical/surgical environment and more.
The program is designed so that you can take individual courses or the entire program and has adopted the
Pan-Canadian Framework of Guiding Principles and Essential Components for IEN Bridging Programs
as one of the key documents guiding program evaluation.

Vaccination requirements
All health care workers in Alberta are required to be vaccinated against Rubella pursuant to the Alberta Public Health Act, Communicable Diseases Regulation.
To be eligible to graduate from the Bridge to Canadian Nursing program, students must complete practicums located in clinical sites which require them to be immunized against Rubella. At this time, if someone has a medical condition or other reason which prevents them from receiving the immunization with the live Rubella vaccine, they will be unable to complete the prerequisites required to complete the program and will not be eligible for graduation from the program.
For more information on immunizations recommended and required of health care workers in Alberta, please see the following resource from Alberta Health Services:
Immunization Recommended for Health Care Students and Students in Other High-Risk Occupation Programs (PDF)
