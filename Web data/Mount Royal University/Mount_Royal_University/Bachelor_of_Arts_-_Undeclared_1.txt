General Education
General Education courses allow students to explore subjects outside their major, providing important breadth to degree programs. Such breadth makes MRU degrees popular with employers, but also significantly enriches what students learn in their degrees. Students may change career directions several times in their working life, and the lifelong learning and a broad knowledge base acquired through General Education will help them make those transitions more easily — and even welcome them. General Education courses can also count towards a minor, as well as counting towards a double major.
