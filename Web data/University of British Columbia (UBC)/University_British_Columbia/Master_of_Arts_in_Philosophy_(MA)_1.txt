Overview
The UBC Masters in Philosophy provides an opportunity for excellent students to study philosophy at an advanced level, to broaden their understanding of some fundamental questions, and to acquire the skills and knowledge that are necessary for the development their own philosophical research.
There are two routes by which a Masters degree in Philosophy can be gained at UBC: a thesis-based route and a coursework based one.
The requirements of the coursework-based route are usually met by taking ten courses, with at least six of these being taught in the Department of Philosophy. Completion of the thesis-based route usually involves taking six courses, and then writing a thesis. In both routes it is normal for students to complete the degree within two years.
Students have considerable flexibility as to the areas of philosophy in which they choose to specialize. Those wishing to study the work of philosophers writing in languages other than English have the opportunity to learn the languages in question. Most of our students also gain experience of teaching philosophy, through working as a teaching assistant in a variety of undergraduate courses.
For specific program requirements, please refer to the departmental program website
What makes the program unique?
The UBC Department of Philosophy is home to a number of internationally celebrated thinkers, with expertise in a broad range of philosophical topics, and with a variety of unique perspectives on the arts, on the biological, social and psychological sciences, on language, on knowledge, on history, and on value.  All of the department’s faculty members work closely with the students who are enrolled in our graduate programs.
The UBC Philosophy Masters program provides a great degree of flexibility, enabling students to shape their study around their own areas of interest and expertise.   The department has a supportive, collegial, and philosophically inspiring culture.  Students have a range of opportunities to participate fully in its intellectual life. They are also encouraged to participate in the broader community of philosophers, with several sources of funding being available that enable students to present their research at international academic conferences.

* Regular, full-time tuition. For on-leave, extension, continuing or part time (if applicable) fees see
UBC Calendar
.
All fees for the year are subject to adjustment and UBC reserves the right to change any fees without notice at any time, including tuition and student fees. Tuition fees are reviewed annually by the UBC Board of Governors. In recent years, tuition increases have been 2% for continuing domestic students and between 2% and 5% for continuing international students. New students may see higher increases in tuition. Admitted students who defer their admission are subject to the potentially higher tuition fees for incoming students effective at the later program start date. In case of a discrepancy between this webpage and the UBC Calendar, the UBC Calendar entry will be held to be correct.
Financial Support
Applicants to UBC have access to a variety of funding options, including merit-based (i.e. based on your academic performance) and need-based (i.e. based on your financial situation) opportunities.
Scholarships & awards (merit-based funding)
All applicants are encouraged to review the
awards listing
to identify potential opportunities to fund their graduate education. The database lists merit-based scholarships and awards and allows for filtering by various criteria, such as domestic vs. international or degree level.
Graduate Research Assistantships (GRA)
Many professors are able to provide Research Assistantships (GRA) from their research grants to support full-time graduate students studying under their supervision. The duties constitute part of the student's graduate degree requirements. A Graduate Research Assistantship is considered a form of fellowship for a period of graduate study and is therefore not covered by a collective agreement. Stipends vary widely, and are dependent on the field of study and the type of research grant from which the assistantship is being funded.
Graduate Teaching Assistantships (GTA)
Graduate programs may have Teaching Assistantships available for registered full-time graduate students. Full teaching assistantships involve 12 hours work per week in preparation, lecturing, or laboratory instruction although many graduate programs offer partial TA appointments at less than 12 hours per week. Teaching assistantship rates are set by collective bargaining between the University and the
Teaching Assistants' Union
.
Graduate Academic Assistantships (GAA)
Academic Assistantships are employment opportunities to perform work that is relevant to the university or to an individual faculty member, but not to support the student’s graduate research and thesis. Wages are considered regular earnings and when paid monthly, include vacation pay.
Financial aid (need-based funding)
Canadian and US applicants may qualify for governmental loans to finance their studies. Please review
eligibility and types of loans
.
All students may be able to access private sector or bank loans.
Foreign government scholarships
Many foreign governments provide support to their citizens in pursuing education abroad. International applicants should check the various governmental resources in their home country, such as the Department of Education, for available scholarships.
Working while studying
The possibility to pursue work to supplement income may depend on the demands the program has on students. It should be carefully weighed if work leads to prolonged program durations or whether work placements can be meaningfully embedded into a program.
International students enrolled as full-time students with a valid study permit can work
on campus
for unlimited hours and work
off-campus
for no more than 20 hours a week.
A good starting point to explore student jobs is the UBC
Work Learn
program or a
Co-Op placement
.
Tax credits and RRSP withdrawals
Students with taxable income in Canada may be able to claim
federal
or
provincial
tax credits.
Canadian residents with RRSP accounts may be able to use the
Lifelong Learning Plan
(LLP) which allows students to withdraw amounts from their registered retirement savings plan (RRSPs) to finance full-time training or education for themselves or their partner.
Please review
Filing taxes in Canada
on the student services website for more information.
Cost Estimator
Applicants have access to the
cost estimator
to develop a financial plan that takes into account various income sources and expenses.
Career Options
Graduate students are attracted to the UBC Philosophy Department from around the world, and they often go on to pursue international careers when they graduate.  Many of the students who graduate from the UBC Masters in Philosophy gain fellowships that enable them to study philosophy at the doctoral level at other world-leading universities. The graduates of our program are also exceptionally well-trained in the analytic and verbal skills that employers outside of academia prize, especially in areas relating to the arts, the media, law, and politics.
