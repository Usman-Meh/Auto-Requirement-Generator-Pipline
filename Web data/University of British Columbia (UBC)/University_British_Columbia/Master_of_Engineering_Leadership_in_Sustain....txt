Overview
The Master of Engineering Leadership (MEL) in Sustainable Process Engineering is currently undergoing a period of reflection and evaluation. Plans are in place to temporarily pause the program in January 2025 for a thorough curriculum review and assessment. This pause aims to ensure the program’s ongoing relevance and impact within the dynamic field of chemical engineering and biotechnology. Discussions are ongoing regarding potential adaptations and refinements to better align with the evolving needs of relevant industries.
Since its inception as Green Bio-Products in 2016, and its subsequent evolution into Sustainable Process Engineering in 2020, this program has consistently been at the forefront of professional education for engineers and technical leaders passionate about innovation within sustainable process industries. Notably, the program integrated advanced technical courses with strategic business education from the esteemed UBC Sauder’s Robert H. Lee Graduate School, equipping students with the skills necessary for leadership roles in forward-thinking organizations.
The curriculum comprehensively covered critical topics in chemical engineering and related biotechnologies, fostering an understanding of innovative processes that minimize carbon and energy footprints while enhancing quality of life and environmental well-being.
Graduates of the program have had the opportunity to:
Engage with top-tier researchers and industry pioneers in chemistry, chemical engineering, and environmental science.
Collaborate with a diverse group of motivated peers, enriching their experience with varied expertise and viewpoints.
Participate in multidisciplinary business courses alongside fellow MEL students, fostering a comprehensive learning environment.
Connect with leading experts and leverage UBC’s programs such as entrepreneurship@UBC and the Creative Destruction Lab to kickstart their own ventures.
Attend exclusive workshops and presentations by industry front-runners, staying updated on the latest trends and developments in their field.
As we contemplate the future of Sustainable Process Engineering, we celebrate the achievements of our alumni, whose successes serve as a testament to the program’s foundational strengths and significant contributions to the field of chemical engineering and biotechnologies. We invite you to explore the accomplishments of our graduates, whose work continues to impact industries and communities worldwide.
