Overview
The MEd degree is designed as a practitioner's degree, for students who wish to acquire the knowledge, skills and experience necessary to work in a professional field. As a professional degree, the MEd is intended for students who wish, upon graduation, to assume positions of leadership in a practical setting or positions requiring more advanced study than that available at the bachelor's level.
TESL graduate students gain experience and understanding in such areas as: current issues in TESL theory and practice, second language acquisition, second language reading and writing, language socialization, language and identity, second language assessment, discourse analysis, critical applied linguistics, and research methods.
For specific program requirements, please refer to the departmental program website
What makes the program unique?
The program faculty have expertise in TESL methods, applied linguistics, critical applied linguistics, discourse analysis, intercultural communication, second language acquisition and socialization, content-based language education, pedagogical and functional grammar, second language reading and writing, issues of language and identity, language in education, multilingual literacies, language policy, and English in immigrant and international communities.
We offer On-Campus or Fully Online options for the MEd TESL program. On-campus MEd programs in the Department can be pursued either full time or part time.

Canada
or the
United States
International countries other than the United States
Each program may set higher academic minimum requirements. Please review the

carefully to understand the program requirements. Meeting the minimum requirements does not guarantee admission as it is a competitive process.

All fees for the year are subject to adjustment and UBC reserves the right to change any fees without notice at any time, including tuition and student fees. Tuition fees are reviewed annually by the UBC Board of Governors. In recent years, tuition increases have been 2% for continuing domestic students and between 2% and 5% for continuing international students. New students may see higher increases in tuition. Admitted students who defer their admission are subject to the potentially higher tuition fees for incoming students effective at the later program start date.

Financial Support
Applicants to UBC have access to a variety of funding options.
Program Funding Packages

Foreign government scholarships
Many foreign governments provide support to their citizens in pursuing education abroad. International applicants should check the various governmental resources in their home country, such as the Department of Education, for available scholarships.
Working while studying
The possibility to pursue work to supplement income may depend on the demands the program has on students. It should be carefully weighed if work leads to prolonged program durations or whether work placements can be meaningfully embedded into a program.
International students enrolled as full-time students with a valid study permit can work
on campus
for unlimited hours and work
off-campus
for no more than 20 hours a week.
A good starting point to explore student jobs is the UBC
Work Learn
