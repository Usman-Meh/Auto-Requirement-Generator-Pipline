History is concerned with the study of the past. It draws on the social sciences and humanities for much of its data and conceptual techniques, but remains essentially a study in the dimension of time, with methods of inquiry appropriate to such a study. Since the study of history involves the examination of people in an almost unlimited variety of situations, it deepens our understanding of people’s capacities and failings. It trains the mind to generalize on the basis of evidence and to distinguish propaganda from fact. You can select a Minor, Major, or Honours in History.
