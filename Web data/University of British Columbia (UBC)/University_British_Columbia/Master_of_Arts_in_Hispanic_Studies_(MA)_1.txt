Overview
The Graduate Program in Hispanic Studies offers a dynamic curriculum focusing on a contextualized knowledge of the languages, literatures, and cultures of Latin America, Spain, and other Spanish-speaking communities within the US and Canada.
For specific program requirements, please refer to the departmental program website
What makes the program unique?
Cutting-Edge Research:
The MA program in Hispanic Studies provides a wide variety of graduate courses taught by a growing team of faculty members specializing in innovative research, from Medieval Spanish literature to 21st-century Latin American and Caribbean cultures. The program offers solid academic training through our research clusters, reading groups, and research seminar. Students may participate in or even lead these initiatives, both within the department and in interdisciplinary centres, such as Green College, the Public Humanities Hub, and the Liu Institute for Global Issues.
Professional Development:
We provide a comprehensive Teaching Assistant training program as well as academic and professional development workshops - on grant writing, publishing, and conference attendance, among other topics - to help graduate students diversify their skillset and make an impact on society. Many graduates from our MA program have successfully obtained teaching positions in junior colleges, secured jobs in nonprofits or the public service, or pursued further doctoral studies at established universities.
Community Involvement:
Our annual Graduate Student Symposium allows graduate students to present their research to the entire Department. The biennial FHIS Graduate Student Conference, organized by the graduate students themselves with the assistance of faculty members, offers a platform to share research results with the wider academic community, network with local and international peers, and plan large-scale academic events. Through the FHIS Learning Centre, graduate students may also volunteer as tutors to help undergraduate students become proficient in the languages that are taught in our Department. In addition, the FHIS Cultural Club encourages students to discuss noteworthy social and cultural phenomena with our tight-knit community, engaging with current debates in our disciplines.

UBC Calendar
.
All fees for the year are subject to adjustment and UBC reserves the right to change any fees without notice at any time, including tuition and student fees. Tuition fees are reviewed annually by the UBC Board of Governors. In recent years, tuition increases have been 2% for continuing domestic students and between 2% and 5% for continuing international students. New students may see higher increases in tuition. Admitted students who defer their admission are subject to the potentially higher tuition fees for incoming students effective at the later program start date. In case of a discrepancy between this webpage and the UBC Calendar, the UBC Calendar entry will be held to be correct.
Financial Support
Applicants to UBC have access to a variety of funding options, including merit-based (i.e. based on your academic performance) and need-based (i.e. based on your financial situation) opportunities.
Program Funding Packages
Graduate students may earn an income through Teaching Assistantships and potential Research Assistantships. We also offer a variety of additional grants and awards, such as the Graduate Student Travel Grant, in addition to university and external fellowships.
Scholarships & awards (merit-based funding)
All applicants are encouraged to review the
awards listing
to identify potential opportunities to fund their graduate education. The database lists merit-based scholarships and awards and allows for filtering by various criteria, such as domestic vs. international or degree level.
Graduate Research Assistantships (GRA)
Many professors are able to provide Research Assistantships (GRA) from their research grants to support full-time graduate students studying under their supervision. The duties constitute part of the student's graduate degree requirements. A Graduate Research Assistantship is considered a form of fellowship for a period of graduate study and is therefore not covered by a collective agreement. Stipends vary widely, and are dependent on the field of study and the type of research grant from which the assistantship is being funded.
Graduate Teaching Assistantships (GTA)
Graduate programs may have Teaching Assistantships available for registered full-time graduate students. Full teaching assistantships involve 12 hours work per week in preparation, lecturing, or laboratory instruction although many graduate programs offer partial TA appointments at less than 12 hours per week. Teaching assistantship rates are set by collective bargaining between the University and the
Teaching Assistants' Union
.
Graduate Academic Assistantships (GAA)
Academic Assistantships are employment opportunities to perform work that is relevant to the university or to an individual faculty member, but not to support the student’s graduate research and thesis. Wages are considered regular earnings and when paid monthly, include vacation pay.
Financial aid (need-based funding)
Canadian and US applicants may qualify for governmental loans to finance their studies. Please review
eligibility and types of loans
.
All students may be able to access private sector or bank loans.
Foreign government scholarships
Many foreign governments provide support to their citizens in pursuing education abroad. International applicants should check the various governmental resources in their home country, such as the Department of Education, for available scholarships.
Working while studying
The possibility to pursue work to supplement income may depend on the demands the program has on students. It should be carefully weighed if work leads to prolonged program durations or whether work placements can be meaningfully embedded into a program.
International students enrolled as full-time students with a valid study permit can work
on campus
for unlimited hours and work
off-campus
for no more than 20 hours a week.
A good starting point to explore student jobs is the UBC
Work Learn
program or a
Co-Op placement
.
Tax credits and RRSP withdrawals
Students with taxable income in Canada may be able to claim
federal
or
provincial
tax credits.
Canadian residents with RRSP accounts may be able to use the
Lifelong Learning Plan
(LLP) which allows students to withdraw amounts from their registered retirement savings plan (RRSPs) to finance full-time training or education for themselves or their partner.
Please review
Filing taxes in Canada
on the student services website for more information.
Cost Estimator
Applicants have access to the
cost estimator
to develop a financial plan that takes into account various income sources and expenses.
Career Options
The M.A. prepares students for teaching positions in junior colleges. Students who recently graduated have pursued their studies in Library Science, Education, and Hispanic studies at the doctoral level. In addition, former students have obtained positions in the public and private sectors.
