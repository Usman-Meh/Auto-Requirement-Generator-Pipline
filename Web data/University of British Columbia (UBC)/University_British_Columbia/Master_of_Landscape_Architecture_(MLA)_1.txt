Overview
The Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA) graduate degree program offers an accredited three-year curriculum. This professional course of study is highly demanding with a large proportion of the curriculum being required coursework. Design studios are integrated with courses in landscape history and theory, site analysis and planning, and management of environments. Within this challenging program, opportunities to develop individual identity and special skills are made possible through the selection of specialized topic design studios, thoughtful engagement with electives, and especially through the execution of the Graduation Project.
The academics are coupled with experience in the contemporary profession with internships available for credits. By working in firms or agencies related to student's areas of interest, design development, and documentation skills are honed for future practice. Students build and expand their professional network through these positions and small student-faculty ratios.
The School coordinates a public lecture series with students, faculty, and guests from local landscape architecture affiliates. These informal discourses offer feedback and advice from a broad audience for students presenting their initiatives and projects.
Our full-time faculty and local professional design community are actively involved in studio reviews, graduation project committees, and mentorship programs. Within the Faculty of Applied Science, students have access to a research library ranked among the best in Canada and other faculty in engineering or community and regional planning. With Study Abroad, there are opportunities to be engaged with the ever-changing cultural concerns in architecture and landscape architecture.
For specific program requirements, please refer to the departmental program website
Spending time as a student at UBC helped me to consider diverse perspectives, possibilities, and historical and spatial contexts, to think through them quickly and iteratively, and to review and revise approaches to check whether or not they work in practice.

Tuition fees are reviewed annually by the UBC Board of Governors. In recent years, tuition increases have been 2% for continuing domestic students and between 2% and 5% for continuing international students. New students may see higher increases in tuition. Admitted students who defer their admission are subject to the potentially higher tuition fees for incoming students effective at the later program start date. In case of a discrepancy between this webpage and the UBC Calendar, the UBC Calendar entry will be held to be correct.
Financial Support
Applicants to UBC have access to a variety of funding options.
Employer support
Organizations may provide their employees with tuition benefits as part of an employment package to support lifelong learning of their workforce.

Foreign government scholarships
Many foreign governments provide support to their citizens in pursuing education abroad. International applicants should check the various governmental resources in their home country, such as the Department of Education, for available scholarships.
Working while studying
The possibility to pursue work to supplement income may depend on the demands the program has on students. It should be carefully weighed if work leads to prolonged program durations or whether work placements can be meaningfully embedded into a program.
International students enrolled as full-time students with a valid study permit can work
on campus
for unlimited hours and work
off-campus
for no more than 20 hours a week.
A good starting point to explore student jobs is the UBC
