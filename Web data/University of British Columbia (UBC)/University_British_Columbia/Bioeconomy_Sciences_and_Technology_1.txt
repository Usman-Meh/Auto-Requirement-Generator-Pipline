Bioeconomy refers to the parts of the economy that involve the production of renewable biological resources (e.g., wood, plants, wood waste, and organic waste) that are transformed into valuable products (e.g., biofuels, bioplastics, textiles, food additives, and medicine).
UBC Forestry’s Bioeconomy Sciences and Technology is the first program in Canada to provide a multidisciplinary and comprehensive education that’s focused on the scientific, economic, and policy issues related to the growing bioeconomy and creating a sustainable future. As a student in this program you’ll gain a solid foundation for the innovative design and development of renewable materials, energy, and sustainable land-use strategies.
Experiential learning and research
As a Bioeconomy Sciences and Technology student, you’ll gain hands-on learning through labs, field trips, and a capstone project. You also have the option to minor in Commerce.
Campus features
UBC’s Vancouver campus is home to the
