Overview
The M.N. Nurse Practitioner (M.N.-N.P.) program prepares nurse practitioners to work in primary care settings. Graduates assess, diagnose, and treat common and predictable conditions across the lifespan, and are eligible to apply for registration as Nurse Practitioner (Family) in British Columbia. Applicants must meet general requirements of the UBC Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies, hold current registration as a Registered Nurse in British Columbia, and have completed a minimum of three years of clinical practice as a registered nurse. We seek applicants with demonstrated clinical excellence, and autonomous action.
For specific program requirements, please refer to the departmental program website
What makes the program unique?
The UBC School of Nursing, Master of Nursing - Nurse Practitioner (MN-NP) Program offers studies with a community of professors and clinicians at the forefront of primary care. This two year full-time on-campus program leads to the degree of Master of Nursing and is recognized by the British Columbia College of Nurses and Midwives. Program completion creates eligibility for licensure as a Nurse Practitioner in BC.
Graduates of our UBC MN-NP Program are in demand by health authorities for practice in both community and hospital settings. They are well prepared to practice collaboratively and autonomously in primary care settings, and lead in interpretation and application of new knowledge generated to improve practice.
The MN-NP program at UBC was attractive to me for many reasons, one being that it would be in-class learning with peers and colleagues. Being someone who thrives off of group discussions and collaboration this was very important to me as I started to look into different institutions.
Erin Anker
Program Structure
In accordance with the professional and regulatory requirements associated with advanced nursing practice, the MN-NP program normally comprises 56 credits of coursework, combining 9 credits of graduate level theory courses (M.S.N. program core requirements), up to 44 credits of primary health care theory and practice training, and a 3-credit culminating scholarly project.
