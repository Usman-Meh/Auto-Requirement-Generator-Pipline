What makes the program unique?
Our mandatory Global Immersion Experience (GIE) allows each of our full-time MBA candidates to spend 2-weeks abroad, getting the opportunity to consult on business problems for local organizations. They begin preparing for the experience on campus before they depart, designing briefs and doing research. It's an invaluable experience that helps students understand cultural implications of business decisions and adapting to different ways of doing things.
UBC Sauder is the only Canadian member of the prestigious Global Network for Advanced Management (GNAM), a partnership of 30 top business schools spearheaded by the Yale School of Management. The network gives MBA candidates from partner schools opportunities to gain more international experience during their education, including a dual degree option with Yale School of Management, Global Network Weeks, and Global Network Courses.
