Overview
The Master of Engineering Leadership (MEL) in Integrated Water Management is entering a period of reflection and evaluation, with the program set to be paused in January 2025 for a comprehensive curriculum review and assessment. This pause marks a moment of thoughtful consideration on the future direction of the program, with an emphasis on ensuring its relevance and impact in the evolving field of water management. The pathway forward for the program remains under contemplation, with discussions ongoing about how best to adapt and possibly reshape its offerings to meet the current and future needs of the water management industries.
From its inception in 2016 through 2024, the MEL in Integrated Water Management has served as a groundbreaking professional degree aimed at engineers and technical leaders passionate about leading and innovating within the water management sectors. The program distinguished itself through a blend of advanced technical courses and strategic business education from the esteemed UBC Sauder’s Robert H. Lee Graduate School. This combination equipped students with the skills necessary to take on leadership roles in forward-thinking organizations.
The curriculum provided comprehensive coverage of critical topics in the field, including water treatment technologies, regulatory frameworks, water and wastewater management strategies, environmental fluid mechanics, and engineering hydrology, complemented by solid grounding in business strategy, innovation, operations, project management, and leadership.
Graduates of the program have:
Enhanced their technical and analytical capabilities to effectively manage complex water systems.
Completed significant capstone projects, deepening their understanding and expertise in specific areas of water management.
Benefited from the insights and expertise of esteemed faculty and industry professionals.
Built valuable professional networks through collaboration with fellow MEL students across various disciplines.
Acquired essential business, project management, and interpersonal skills, positioning them to excel in leadership roles and confidently address the challenges of their fields.
As we contemplate the future of the Integrated Water Management program, we continue to celebrate the achievements of our alumni. Their successes serve as a testament to the program’s foundational strengths and the significant contributions they are making in the field of water management. We invite you to explore the accomplishments of our graduates, whose work continues to impact the industry and communities around the world.
