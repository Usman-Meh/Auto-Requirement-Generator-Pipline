Overview
The Masters of Law Common Law (LLM CL) Program is a year-long, course-based professional program that provides foundational training in the Canadian common law system for foreign trained law graduates. The program has two start dates. Applicants with common law legal training may begin the LLM CL Program in either May or September.  Applicants without formal common law training, such as civil law trained or applicants from mixed legal traditions must begin the LLM CL Program in May. The May start date allows student to complete a number of foundational courses in Canadian common law before joining the advanced graduate or upper-year J.D. courses offered in September.
This program supports students in completing their assigned National Committee on Accreditation subjects and in addition allows students to choose from the broad array of graduate and upper-year JD course offerings in the Peter A. Allard School of Law.
For specific program requirements, please refer to the departmental program website
What makes the program unique?
The Peter A. Allard School of Law, one of Canada's leading law schools, is proud of its tradition in graduate student training and is home to one of the country's oldest and most well-established graduate programs.
The program, the first of its kind in Canada, offers students the opportunity to complete a masters' degree in Law while also working towards the course-work requirements for the practice of law in Canada. If you have a foreign legal training and are interested in practicing law in Canada, then you must consult with and apply to the National Committee on Accreditation (NCA), the body charged with determining the additional qualifications required for foreign-trained lawyers to practice in Canada. The courses in the Masters of Law (LLM) Common Law Program degree are designed to meet NCA requirements.
UBC offers world-class education and a supportive network of professors and staff, which helps you grow on a holistic level and prepares you to take on the world!

In recent years, tuition increases have been 2% for continuing domestic students and between 2% and 5% for continuing international students. New students may see higher increases in tuition.

Financial Support
Applicants to UBC have access to a variety of funding options.
Program Funding Packages

UBC Bursary
at the link.
Employer support
Organizations may provide their employees with tuition benefits as part of an employment package to support lifelong learning of their workforce.

Financial aid (need-based funding)
Canadian and US applicants may qualify for governmental loans to finance their studies. Please review
eligibility and types of loans
.
All students may be able to access private sector or bank loans.
Foreign government scholarships
Many foreign governments provide support to their citizens in pursuing education abroad. International applicants should check the various governmental resources in their home country, such as the Department of Education, for available scholarships.
Working while studying
The possibility to pursue work to supplement income may depend on the demands the program has on students. It should be carefully weighed if work leads to prolonged program durations or whether work placements can be meaningfully embedded into a program.
International students enrolled as full-time students with a valid study permit can work
on campus
for unlimited hours and work
off-campus
for no more than 20 hours a week.
A good starting point to explore student jobs is the UBC
Work Learn
program or a
Co-Op placement

federal
or
provincial
tax credits.
Canadian residents with RRSP accounts may be able to use the
