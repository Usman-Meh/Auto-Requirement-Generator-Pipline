Overview
The Master of Engineering Leadership (MEL) in Dependable Software Systems is entering an exciting phase of transformation. Beginning January 2024, we will temporarily pause the program to embark on a comprehensive curriculum review and assessment. This strategic pause is the first step towards relaunching the program in a new and innovative format that will meet the evolving demands of the software systems industries. Stay tuned for updates on this dynamic evolution, as we aim to unveil a revitalized program that promises to further empower engineers and technical leaders with cutting-edge skills and knowledge.
The MEL in Dependable Software Systems, from its inception in 2016 through 2023, has been a pioneering professional degree. It was meticulously designed for engineers and technical leaders striving to lead and innovate within the software systems sectors. This program stood out by integrating rigorous engineering coursework with strategic business education from the prestigious UBC Sauder’s Robert H. Lee Graduate School, thereby equipping students with a robust combination of technical expertise and business acumen.
The curriculum covered essential areas such as software testing and verification, error-resilient computing, security, and privacy, alongside foundational business strategies, innovation, operations, project management, and leadership skills. This holistic approach ensured that graduates:
Advanced their technical and analytical competencies, essential for developing and maintaining reliable software systems.
Undertook a significant capstone project, deepening their domain expertise.
Benefited from the wisdom and experience of distinguished faculty and industry luminaries.
Built extensive professional networks through collaboration with peers from diverse MEL disciplines.
Acquired key business, project management, and interpersonal skills, enabling them to ascend to leadership roles and navigate complex challenges with confidence.
As we prepare for the next chapter of the Dependable Software Systems program, we celebrate the achievements of our alumni, whose success stories underscore the enduring impact of their education. We invite you to explore the accomplishments of our alumni, a testament to the program’s foundational strength and the bright future that lies ahead in its refreshed incarnation.
