Overview
Highly-qualified urban forestry professionals are becoming increasingly necessary in cities around the world due to the rapid pace and scale of urbanization, the need to adapt to multiple impacts of climate change in cities, and increasing demand from the public for the recreational, psychological, and health benefits that trees and greenspaces provide. This 30-credit, 25-month part-time program, is based on a comprehensive, interdisciplinary perspective of urban forestry with strong emphasis on governance and strategic management of urban forests. Students will learn how trees and vegetation grow and are managed in urban settings, but the emphasis of the program will be on skills and knowledge related to leadership and governance; project management and business skills; the public policy and  planning context of urban forestry; green infrastructure planning; communication and marketing; public involvement; and urban forest resource and benefit assessment. The program is built around 3 critical management skills that are woven throughout the program: creativity, decision-making, and leadership. It is targeted for professionals with urban forestry related work experience in the public, private or not-for-profit sector, or professionals looking to move into the field of urban forestry.
