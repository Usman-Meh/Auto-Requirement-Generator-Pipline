Overview
The Master of Architecture (MArch) graduate degree program offers an accredited three-year curriculum. This professional course of study is highly demanding with a large proportion of the curriculum being required coursework. Design studios are integrated with courses in architecture history and theory, technical and material systems, and design media and representation. Within this challenging program, opportunities to develop individual identity and special skills are made possible through the selection of special topic design studios, thoughtful engagement with electives, and especially through the execution of the Graduation Project.
For specific program requirements, please refer to the departmental program website
What makes the program unique?
Each student furthers their network by working with full-time faculty and local professional design community who are active participants in studio reviews, graduation project committees, and the mentorship program. Within the Faculty of Applied Science, students have access to a research library ranked among the best in Canada and other faculty in engineering or community and regional planning. With Study Abroad, there are opportunities to be engaged with the ever-changing cultural concerns in architecture and landscape architecture.
I chose to attend the School of Architecture and Landscape Architecture at UBC because the school and its staff believed in me from the beginning.

Program Structure
The full program is 119 credits. Students entering the program with an undergraduate degree normally take three and one-half years of full-time study to complete the requirements. Students holding a pre-professional architecture degree will be considered for advanced placement. At the time of application, the program's Admissions Committee will determine the extent of advanced placement on the basis of the applicant's undergraduate transcript and portfolio.

All fees for the year are subject to adjustment and UBC reserves the right to change any fees without notice at any time, including tuition and student fees. Tuition fees are reviewed annually by the UBC Board of Governors. In recent years, tuition increases have been 2% for continuing domestic students and between 2% and 5% for continuing international students. New students may see higher increases in tuition. Admitted students who defer their admission are subject to the potentially higher tuition fees for incoming students effective at the later program start date. In case of a discrepancy between this webpage and the UBC Calendar, the UBC Calendar entry will be held to be correct.
Financial Support
Applicants to UBC have access to a variety of funding options.
Employer support
Organizations may provide their employees with tuition benefits as part of an employment package to support lifelong learning of their workforce.
Scholarships & awards (merit-based funding)
Professional / course-based programs usually do

provide merit-based funding. Some programs may offer bursaries.
Financial aid (need-based funding)
Canadian and US applicants may qualify for governmental loans to finance their studies. Please review

All students may be able to access private sector or bank loans.
Foreign government scholarships
Many foreign governments provide support to their citizens in pursuing education abroad. International applicants should check the various governmental resources in their home country, such as the Department of Education, for available scholarships.
Working while studying
The possibility to pursue work to supplement income may depend on the demands the program has on students. It should be carefully weighed if work leads to prolonged program durations or whether work placements can be meaningfully embedded into a program.
International students enrolled as full-time students with a valid study permit can work
on campus
for unlimited hours and work
off-campus
for no more than 20 hours a week.
A good starting point to explore student jobs is the UBC
Work Learn
