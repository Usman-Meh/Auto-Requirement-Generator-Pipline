One of IB Biology, IB Chemistry, or IB Physics (see Related courses below)
Grade 11 or equivalent Chemistry
Grade 11 Biology (see Related courses below)
If you intend to major in Wood Products or specialize in
Harvest Planning and Engineering
(Forest Operations), Physics 11 is strongly recommended.
Note: Grade 11 Biology, Chemistry and Physics requirements listed above are only relevant to students who are
not
completing the equivalent IB Diploma Biology, Chemistry and/or Physics courses. For students studying outside of Canada, some examples of courses that may be accepted as Grade 11 equivalents are junior-level courses for American students, and IGCSE and O Level for those following British-patterned curricula.
Related courses
The following
subject categories
