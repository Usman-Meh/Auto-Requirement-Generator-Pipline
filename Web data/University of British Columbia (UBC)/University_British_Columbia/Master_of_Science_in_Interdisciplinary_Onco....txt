Overview
The Interdisciplinary Oncology Program (IOP) is a graduate program designed to appeal to a broad range of students interested in cancer research. IOP offers advanced study and research in a variety of fields relating to oncology, including: molecular and cellular biology, tumour microenvironment, molecular pathology, tumour immunology, biophysics, metastasis, genetics, genetics, bioinformatics, pharmaceutical sciences, radiological sciences, sociobehavioral studies, epidemiology and health economics. The goal of the program is to provide graduate students from diverse backgrounds, with an education in a number of oncology-related disciplines and to provide intensive training opportunities in specialized aspects of cancer research. The IOP has been training the next generation of cancer research leaders since 2001.
For specific program requirements, please refer to the departmental program website
What makes the program unique?
The IOP integrates diverse areas of oncology research by offering two required courses that provide an interdisciplinary perspective of oncology in a form that is accessible to students from diverse backgrounds. In addition to these required courses, IOP students have the freedom to take several elective courses that provide intensive training in one or more subject areas specific to the student's research area, while also giving an opportunity to gain expertise in disciplines that have potential synergy with their primary specialization. An innovative rotation course is a unique option for students to gain hands-on experience by rotating through specialty laboratories. Students have access to UBC Faculty members, scientists, and clinicians through the world-renowned BC Cancer to gain a practical perspective on oncology treatments and outcomes.

Research Information
Program Components
Once students are enrolled in the IOP, they will have an opportunity to design a training program that allows for interdisciplinary course selection, intensive research training in a particular area of interest, and potential research rotations through other IOP faculty member's labs to gain insight into research areas outside their specific supervisor's research.
Research Facilities
The majority of IOP supervisors have research programs located off-campus at the BC Cancer Research Institute, the Prostate Centre at Vancouver General Hospital, or other hospital-related research buildings. IOP supervisors can also be found on the UBC-Vancouver campus or at BC Cancer facilities in Victoria and Prince George.

UBC Calendar
.
All fees for the year are subject to adjustment and UBC reserves the right to change any fees without notice at any time, including tuition and student fees. Tuition fees are reviewed annually by the UBC Board of Governors. In recent years, tuition increases have been 2% for continuing domestic students and between 2% and 5% for continuing international students. New students may see higher increases in tuition. Admitted students who defer their admission are subject to the potentially higher tuition fees for incoming students effective at the later program start date. In case of a discrepancy between this webpage and the UBC Calendar, the UBC Calendar entry will be held to be correct.
Financial Support
Applicants to UBC have access to a variety of funding options, including merit-based (i.e. based on your academic performance) and need-based (i.e. based on your financial situation) opportunities.
Program Funding Packages
The mandatory minimum stipend for a full time IOP MSc graduate student (Canadian or international) is $24,300 per year. This stipend may be derived from competitive scholarships and/or from the Supervisor’s research funding. Admission to the IOP requires a commitment from the Supervisor to ensure the student will be supported to the minimum funding level for the duration of their studies. Students are not permitted to self-fund their graduate program.
Students must pay tuition from their stipend, with the tuition amount depending on whether the student is domestic or international (see above).
The minimum duration of the annual stipend is normally 2.5 years for an MSc student. If the student has not completed their program requirements after 2.5 years, continued funding is at the discretion of the Supervisor and will depend on satisfactory academic and research progress in consultation with the student’s Supervisory Committee. The Supervisor must inform the student in writing at least six months prior to the end-date of the student's stipend (copied to the IOP office). Termination of funding for other justifiable reasons must be approved by a majority of the IOP Executive Committee.
Scholarships & awards (merit-based funding)
All applicants are encouraged to review the
awards listing
to identify potential opportunities to fund their graduate education. The database lists merit-based scholarships and awards and allows for filtering by various criteria, such as domestic vs. international or degree level.
Graduate Research Assistantships (GRA)
Many professors are able to provide Research Assistantships (GRA) from their research grants to support full-time graduate students studying under their supervision. The duties constitute part of the student's graduate degree requirements. A Graduate Research Assistantship is considered a form of fellowship for a period of graduate study and is therefore not covered by a collective agreement. Stipends vary widely, and are dependent on the field of study and the type of research grant from which the assistantship is being funded.
Graduate Teaching Assistantships (GTA)
Graduate programs may have Teaching Assistantships available for registered full-time graduate students. Full teaching assistantships involve 12 hours work per week in preparation, lecturing, or laboratory instruction although many graduate programs offer partial TA appointments at less than 12 hours per week. Teaching assistantship rates are set by collective bargaining between the University and the
Teaching Assistants' Union
.
Graduate Academic Assistantships (GAA)
Academic Assistantships are employment opportunities to perform work that is relevant to the university or to an individual faculty member, but not to support the student’s graduate research and thesis. Wages are considered regular earnings and when paid monthly, include vacation pay.
Financial aid (need-based funding)
Canadian and US applicants may qualify for governmental loans to finance their studies. Please review
eligibility and types of loans
.
All students may be able to access private sector or bank loans.
Foreign government scholarships
Many foreign governments provide support to their citizens in pursuing education abroad. International applicants should check the various governmental resources in their home country, such as the Department of Education, for available scholarships.
Working while studying
The possibility to pursue work to supplement income may depend on the demands the program has on students. It should be carefully weighed if work leads to prolonged program durations or whether work placements can be meaningfully embedded into a program.
International students enrolled as full-time students with a valid study permit can work
on campus
for unlimited hours and work
off-campus
for no more than 20 hours a week.
A good starting point to explore student jobs is the UBC
Work Learn
program or a
Co-Op placement
.
Tax credits and RRSP withdrawals
Students with taxable income in Canada may be able to claim
federal
or
provincial
tax credits.
Canadian residents with RRSP accounts may be able to use the
Lifelong Learning Plan
(LLP) which allows students to withdraw amounts from their registered retirement savings plan (RRSPs) to finance full-time training or education for themselves or their partner.
Please review
Filing taxes in Canada
on the student services website for more information.
Cost Estimator
Applicants have access to the
cost estimator
to develop a financial plan that takes into account various income sources and expenses.
Career Options
