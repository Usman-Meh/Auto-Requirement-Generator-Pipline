Overview
Our programs in Literacy Education engage teachers and other professional educators in the study of rich language and literacy practices from early childhood through adolescence and adulthood. Literacy studies have expanded dramatically in recent years and our internationally known Faculty draw on many disciplines that inform the study of language and literacy education, including cognitive, linguistic, anthropological, cultural, literary, critical and post-structural perspectives.
For specific program requirements, please refer to the departmental program website
What makes the program unique?
The program faculty have expertise in: Indigenous languages and literacies, children’s literature and cultural texts, drama and theatre education, literary and literacy practices in families, schools, and communities, and digital cultures, multimodality, and communication ecologies/studies.
LITR graduate students gain experience and understanding in such areas as: Indigenous languages and literacies; literature and cultural texts for children and youth; drama and theatre education in schools and communities; literary and literacy practices in families, schools, and communities; digital cultures, multimodality, and communication ecologies/studies.
The MEd degree in Literacy Education is designed as a practitioner's degree, for students who wish to acquire the knowledge, skills and experience necessary to work in a professional field. The MEd program can be pursued either full-time or part-time.
A small number of MEd students each year who demonstrate outstanding performance and whose research interests align with those of an available supervisor may be allowed to switch to the MA program after their second semester.

Many foreign governments provide support to their citizens in pursuing education abroad. International applicants should check the various governmental resources in their home country, such as the Department of Education, for available scholarships.
Working while studying
The possibility to pursue work to supplement income may depend on the demands the program has on students. It should be carefully weighed if work leads to prolonged program durations or whether work placements can be meaningfully embedded into a program.
International students enrolled as full-time students with a valid study permit can work
on campus
for unlimited hours and work
off-campus
for no more than 20 hours a week.
A good starting point to explore student jobs is the UBC
Work Learn
