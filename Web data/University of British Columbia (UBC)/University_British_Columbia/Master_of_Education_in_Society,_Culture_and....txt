Overview
The MA and MEd degree concentration in Society, Culture and Politics in Education (SCPE) addresses the history of education, sociology of education, politics of education, philosophy of education, and cultural aspects of education.
We define education very broadly to include formal school contexts, as well as non-formal education and informal learning at all levels and life stages. The SCPE concentration examines the meaning and outcomes of critical theories of education, policies, and practices for public life in Canada and across the world. As scholars working within and across many disciplines, we view education as a central field within the arts, social sciences, and humanities.
Students and faculty associated with the SCPE concentration share interests in the part played by education in developing socially, ecologically, politically and culturally just societies.
The SCPE MEd is a 30-credit program that is primarily course based. The focus of the M.Ed. program is inquiry into educational practice, and students applying to this program should have an interest in connecting their coursework to educational practice. Examples of educational practice include (but are not limited to) K-12 teaching, community education, outdoor education, art education, educational practice as part of international development, and facilitation practice.
For specific program requirements, please refer to the departmental program website
What makes the program unique?
Educational Studies does something that’s quite unique: it focuses on education as a political, social, and cultural phenomenon. We have a strong group of scholars from a variety of disciplines who broaden the aperture on what education means to, and in, different communities.

Working while studying
The possibility to pursue work to supplement income may depend on the demands the program has on students. It should be carefully weighed if work leads to prolonged program durations or whether work placements can be meaningfully embedded into a program.
