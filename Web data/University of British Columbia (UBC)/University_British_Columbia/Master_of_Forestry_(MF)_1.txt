Overview
The Master of Forestry (MF) is a course-based degree program offered as part of a dual-degree partnership with other European and Canadian Universities: TRANSFOR-M (Transatlantic Forestry Master). This partnership is a unique course-based educational experience, which provides MF students with the opportunity to explore Forestry both in Europe and Canada.
For specific program requirements, please refer to the departmental program website
What makes the program unique?
The overreaching aim of the program is to educate the next generation of globally minded forest and environmental managers and scientists on the cultural differences, diverse historical contexts, and differing economic drivers that exist in Canadian and European natural resource management approaches. By drawing on the expertise and opportunities through UBC MF degree and various graduate programs across five forestry schools in Europe, we have been able to develop a graduate program with unparalleled possibilities and experiences for participants. Earning two masters degrees from two world-class forestry schools enhances the opportunities available to graduates.
Program Structure
Admitted students register in the MF program at UBC for a two-year period. Within that timeframe, one year is spent in Europe completing degree requirements at the chosen partner institution, and the second year is completed at UBC-Vancouver completing the MF degree requirements, resulting in conferral of two separate Master’s credentials.
Taken separately, both degrees would take three years to complete. The dual degree program option makes it possible to earn both degrees in two years of study by allowing students to be enrolled continuously through this period and by allowing students to apply 30 credits earned as part of the UBC MF degree towards the European degree. In order to receive both degrees students must fulfill the individual program requirements for each institution’s degree.
The participating European Universities:
Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Germany
Bangor University, Wales, UK
University of Eastern Finland, Finland
University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria
University of Padova, Italy
The European degrees available for UBC MF students:
M.Sc. Forest Sciences (Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg)
M.Sc. Agroforestry (Bangor University / Wales)
M.Sc. Conservation and Land Management (Bangor University / Wales)
M.Sc. Environmental Forestry (Bangor University / Wales)
M.Sc. Agriculture and Forestry (University of Eastern Finland)
M.Sc. Mountain Forestry (University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna)
M.Sc. Forest Science (University of Padova)
In order to receive both degrees students must fulfill the individual program requirements for each institution’s degree.
Year One (September to August)
MF students register at UBC but spend the year in Europe at their chosen TRANSFOR-M partner institution and complete that institution’s Master program degree requirements (dual registration). UBC registration will be FRST 548 Major Essay.
Year Two (September to April)
MF students return to UBC and complete a total of 30 credits to qualify for MF degree conferral: either a 3-credit major essay with 27 credits of approved course work, or a 6-credit major essay with 24 credits of approved course work. Course work must include FRST 544 (Technical Communications). FRST 547 (Forestry in BC) is strongly recommended for students from outside of British Columbia or without a UBC Forestry undergraduate degree, and FRST 545 (Technical Writing) is also recommended. MF graduation is expected in the Spring, but continued registration through to August or December is allowed, if further time is approved by the Program Director (continuing tuition is assessed for extra terms).
* Flexibility may be offered for students to complete their UBC MF requirements in Year One and go to Europe in Year Two. Please discuss this option with the UBC TRANSFOR-M Director during your interview.

Admission Information & Requirements
Program Instructions
Admission to the TRANSFOR-M through UBC requires an academic background in science, applied science, agricultural sciences, social science or forestry. Given that the number of applicants exceeds the number of positions available, a record that satisfies basic entrance requirements does not guarantee admission. Applicants wishing to participate in the TRANSFOR-M program must arrange an interview with the UBC TRANSFOR-M Program Director. If you are eligible to apply, you will then apply to UBC Master of Forestry (MF) program though admission is not guaranteed.  Successful applicants who received an offer of admission will then need to apply to the master’s program at the European Host Institution to which they were invited to apply.
1) Check Eligibility
Minimum Academic Requirements
The Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies establishes the minimum admission requirements common to all applicants, usually a minimum overall average in the B+ range (76% at UBC).

Canada
or the
United States
International countries other than the United States
Each program may set higher academic minimum requirements. Please review the
program website
carefully to understand the program requirements. Meeting the minimum requirements does not guarantee admission as it is a competitive process.
English Language Test
Applicants from a university outside Canada in which English is not the primary language of instruction must provide results of an
English language proficiency examination
as part of their application. Tests must have been taken
within the last 24 months
at the time of submission of your application.

* Regular, full-time tuition. For on-leave, extension, continuing or part time (if applicable) fees see
UBC Calendar
.
All fees for the year are subject to adjustment and UBC reserves the right to change any fees without notice at any time, including tuition and student fees. Tuition fees are reviewed annually by the UBC Board of Governors. In recent years, tuition increases have been 2% for continuing domestic students and between 2% and 5% for continuing international students. New students may see higher increases in tuition. Admitted students who defer their admission are subject to the potentially higher tuition fees for incoming students effective at the later program start date. In case of a discrepancy between this webpage and the UBC Calendar, the UBC Calendar entry will be held to be correct.
Financial Support
Applicants to UBC have access to a variety of funding options, including merit-based (i.e. based on your academic performance) and need-based (i.e. based on your financial situation) opportunities.
Program Funding Packages
Each UBC TRANSFOR-M student will pay the UBC MF tuition and student fees for a minimum of two years (6 terms), but will receive a tuition fee waiver at the Host University in Europe. European misc student fees may be assessed.
Paul Heller Memorial Fellowship in International Forestry
A $20,000 fellowship is offered by the Paul and Edwina Heller Memorial Fund in memory of Paul Heller, and is awarded annually to an incoming Master of Forestry (MF) student participating in the TRANSFOR-M international dual-degree program, whose home university is UBC. This award is merit-based; assessment criteria includes intended field of study, academic standing, previous awards, and prior and current engagement in the field of study and community. Assessment is made through review of the student's program application file, as well as a Self-Assessment document for the fellowship. Instructions for submitting the Self-Assessment document are sent to incoming MF students in late June / early July each year, and the recipient will be selected and notified by mid-August. Eligible areas of study: forest management, silviculture, wood science, advanced renewable materials, fire science, entomology, or forest genetics, with connections to climate change and/or the interaction of forests and agriculture.
Faculty of Forestry Graduate Student Travel Award
For course-based Master's students, the award provides support for students to participate in professional development directly related to their area of study. It cannot be used toward internship expenses or student workshops. CBM students are eligible to use the fund once during their degree (one activity) to a maximum of $600 pending funding availability. Funding is limited each year and will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis to eligible applicants.
Forestry Indigenous Grad Student Entrance Scholarship
The Faculty of Forestry makes available annual funds for two scholarships, up to $10,000 each, for Indigenous students entering any of UBC Forestry's Master's programs or PhD program. All Aboriginal students are eligible to apply but priority is given to those whose traditional territory falls, at least in part, within Canada. This includes Canadian First Nations (Status and non-Status), Métis or Inuit students and may include Aboriginal students from Alaska and the northern states of the USA. Scholarship applicants must be starting their first Master's or PhD program at UBC Forestry and have a confirmed Offer of Admission for the coming academic year. If in any given year there are no eligible incoming students, UBC Forestry reserves the right to open the competition to a continuing Indigenous graduate student(s) in good academic standing. Assessment is made through review of the student's program application file, as well as a Statement of Interest document for the scholarship. Full application instructions and deadlines are sent to incoming students in early July each year, and the recipient will be selected and notified by end of August.
Scholarships & awards (merit-based funding)
All applicants are encouraged to review the
awards listing
to identify potential opportunities to fund their graduate education. The database lists merit-based scholarships and awards and allows for filtering by various criteria, such as domestic vs. international or degree level.
Graduate Research Assistantships (GRA)
Many professors are able to provide Research Assistantships (GRA) from their research grants to support full-time graduate students studying under their supervision. The duties constitute part of the student's graduate degree requirements. A Graduate Research Assistantship is considered a form of fellowship for a period of graduate study and is therefore not covered by a collective agreement. Stipends vary widely, and are dependent on the field of study and the type of research grant from which the assistantship is being funded.
Graduate Teaching Assistantships (GTA)
Graduate programs may have Teaching Assistantships available for registered full-time graduate students. Full teaching assistantships involve 12 hours work per week in preparation, lecturing, or laboratory instruction although many graduate programs offer partial TA appointments at less than 12 hours per week. Teaching assistantship rates are set by collective bargaining between the University and the
Teaching Assistants' Union
.
Graduate Academic Assistantships (GAA)
Academic Assistantships are employment opportunities to perform work that is relevant to the university or to an individual faculty member, but not to support the student’s graduate research and thesis. Wages are considered regular earnings and when paid monthly, include vacation pay.
Financial aid (need-based funding)
Canadian and US applicants may qualify for governmental loans to finance their studies. Please review
eligibility and types of loans
.
All students may be able to access private sector or bank loans.
Foreign government scholarships
Many foreign governments provide support to their citizens in pursuing education abroad. International applicants should check the various governmental resources in their home country, such as the Department of Education, for available scholarships.
Working while studying
The possibility to pursue work to supplement income may depend on the demands the program has on students. It should be carefully weighed if work leads to prolonged program durations or whether work placements can be meaningfully embedded into a program.
International students enrolled as full-time students with a valid study permit can work
on campus
for unlimited hours and work
off-campus
for no more than 20 hours a week.
A good starting point to explore student jobs is the UBC
Work Learn
program or a
Co-Op placement
.
Tax credits and RRSP withdrawals
Students with taxable income in Canada may be able to claim
federal
or
provincial
tax credits.
Canadian residents with RRSP accounts may be able to use the
Lifelong Learning Plan
(LLP) which allows students to withdraw amounts from their registered retirement savings plan (RRSPs) to finance full-time training or education for themselves or their partner.
Please review
Filing taxes in Canada
on the student services website for more information.
Cost Estimator
Applicants have access to the
cost estimator
to develop a financial plan that takes into account various income sources and expenses.
