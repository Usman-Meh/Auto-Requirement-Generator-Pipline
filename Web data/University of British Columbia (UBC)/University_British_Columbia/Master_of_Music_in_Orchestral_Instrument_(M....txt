Overview
The Master of Music (M.Mus.) degree in performance is offered to students who have achieved necessary levels of attainment and productivity at the undergraduate level, and who give reasonable promise of further significant accomplishment. This degree is often a final academic step for the musician who wishes to enter the professional world, although it may prove an intermediate step for those wishing to prepare for doctoral training. Performance candidates present a recital or opera performance in lieu of a thesis. A two-year residency is the norm.
For specific program requirements, please refer to the departmental program website
What makes the program unique?
UBC’s MMus in Orchestral Instrument Performance degree program is distinguished by its outstanding faculty performers who play in the Vancouver Symphony, Vancouver Opera Orchestra, National Broadcast Orchestra, Standing Wave, Turning Point Ensemble, and enjoy successful careers as solo recording artists and entrepreneurs.
Students enjoy the opportunity to study with passionate teachers who care a great deal about their students. The School of Music also provides many master classes with internationally renowned guest artists and ample playing opportunities in ensembles of the highest calibre.
The main focus is to allow each student to progress to the apex of their performance potential, and admission is selective and enrollment limited so that all students are allowed ample performance opportunities to do so.
Orchestral Instrument Performance students perform in the Symphonic Wind Ensemble, Concert Winds, Symphony Orchestra, and Jazz Bands, and participate in numerous chamber ensembles and opera productions annually. While in residence at UBC, students are placed in various large ensembles throughout each season so that all students receive training in various repertoires under multiple conductors.
In addition, opportunities for performances in regional community, youth, and professional ensembles — such as the Vancouver Academy Orchestra, Pacific Symphonic Wind Ensemble, Vancouver Youth Symphony Orchestra, Kamloops Symphony, Vancouver Island Symphony, 15th Field Army Band, and many other Vancouver area ensembles — make the UBC School of Music a great place for practical experience in the freelance and community music scene.

UBC Calendar
.
All fees for the year are subject to adjustment and UBC reserves the right to change any fees without notice at any time, including tuition and student fees. Tuition fees are reviewed annually by the UBC Board of Governors. In recent years, tuition increases have been 2% for continuing domestic students and between 2% and 5% for continuing international students. New students may see higher increases in tuition. Admitted students who defer their admission are subject to the potentially higher tuition fees for incoming students effective at the later program start date. In case of a discrepancy between this webpage and the UBC Calendar, the UBC Calendar entry will be held to be correct.
Financial Support
Applicants to UBC have access to a variety of funding options, including merit-based (i.e. based on your academic performance) and need-based (i.e. based on your financial situation) opportunities.
Program Funding Packages
Students admitted to the School of Music’s graduate programs are automatically considered for scholarships under the GSI (Graduate Support Initiative) program. These competitive awards typically range from $1,000 to 12,000 and are guaranteed for two to four years.
Scholarships & awards (merit-based funding)
All applicants are encouraged to review the
awards listing
to identify potential opportunities to fund their graduate education. The database lists merit-based scholarships and awards and allows for filtering by various criteria, such as domestic vs. international or degree level.
Graduate Research Assistantships (GRA)
Many professors are able to provide Research Assistantships (GRA) from their research grants to support full-time graduate students studying under their supervision. The duties constitute part of the student's graduate degree requirements. A Graduate Research Assistantship is considered a form of fellowship for a period of graduate study and is therefore not covered by a collective agreement. Stipends vary widely, and are dependent on the field of study and the type of research grant from which the assistantship is being funded.
Graduate Teaching Assistantships (GTA)
Graduate programs may have Teaching Assistantships available for registered full-time graduate students. Full teaching assistantships involve 12 hours work per week in preparation, lecturing, or laboratory instruction although many graduate programs offer partial TA appointments at less than 12 hours per week. Teaching assistantship rates are set by collective bargaining between the University and the
Teaching Assistants' Union
.
Graduate Academic Assistantships (GAA)
Academic Assistantships are employment opportunities to perform work that is relevant to the university or to an individual faculty member, but not to support the student’s graduate research and thesis. Wages are considered regular earnings and when paid monthly, include vacation pay.
Financial aid (need-based funding)
Canadian and US applicants may qualify for governmental loans to finance their studies. Please review
eligibility and types of loans
.
All students may be able to access private sector or bank loans.
Foreign government scholarships
Many foreign governments provide support to their citizens in pursuing education abroad. International applicants should check the various governmental resources in their home country, such as the Department of Education, for available scholarships.
Working while studying
The possibility to pursue work to supplement income may depend on the demands the program has on students. It should be carefully weighed if work leads to prolonged program durations or whether work placements can be meaningfully embedded into a program.
International students enrolled as full-time students with a valid study permit can work
on campus
for unlimited hours and work
off-campus
for no more than 20 hours a week.
A good starting point to explore student jobs is the UBC
Work Learn
program or a
Co-Op placement
.
Tax credits and RRSP withdrawals
Students with taxable income in Canada may be able to claim
federal
or
provincial
tax credits.
Canadian residents with RRSP accounts may be able to use the
Lifelong Learning Plan
(LLP) which allows students to withdraw amounts from their registered retirement savings plan (RRSPs) to finance full-time training or education for themselves or their partner.
Please review

Cost Estimator
Applicants have access to the
cost estimator
to develop a financial plan that takes into account various income sources and expenses.
