Overview
The LL.M. in Taxation is a one year, full time non-thesis degree, with a part-time option. Students in the LLM Tax program complete 30 credits, consisting of 6 credits for the required course in Foundations in Tax Law. Out of the 30 credits, at least 24 elective credits have to be taken in tax law and tax policy courses (up to 4 of which can be a directed research project supervised by a UBC Faculty member or can be taken through courses offered at another Faculty on approval by the Director of the Program and the other Faculty), and up to 6 elective credits in other law courses. For most full-time students, two academic terms plus the mandatory introductory intensive course taught from July to August will be required to the complete the course requirements.
For specific program requirements, please refer to the departmental program website
What makes the program unique?
The LL.M. in Taxation will provide graduates with a depth of knowledge and level of technical expertise in tax law beyond that which can be acquired in a basic law degree or other relevant disciplines. Mandatory courses will ensure that students have a solid foundation in core areas of tax law and practice, while optional courses will give students the ability to develop expertise in areas of interest.
