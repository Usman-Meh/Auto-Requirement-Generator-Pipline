Your future
You’ll graduate from the Food Science program ready to work in the food industry, an exciting field of global importance that is undergoing rapid change.  A recent survey of alumni and employers showed a need for food scientists in nearly all areas of the sector, including roles like research and development, regulation, quality control, food safety, processing, food marketing, and management. The breadth of UBC’s Food Science program means that you’ll graduate well prepared for these varied jobs, and with additional background in food quality management, regulation, and sustainability in response to these industry needs.
UBC stories
"I travel to places like West Africa to visit the farms that we buy our cocoa from, so that’s a real connection back to my roots, in terms of agriculture in Land and Food Systems," says Peter, president and chocolate scientist at Purdys Chocolatier.
