Overview
The Master of Applied Science is a Research degree requiring a thesis.   Students can specialize in any of the following areas:  social issues in mining, mining engineering, mineral processing, mining and the environment, Rock mechanics, Mine Economics, Safety, Corporate Social Responsibility, etc.
Backed by an unparalleled reputation for expertise and innovation in mineral extraction, mineral processing and environmental protection, the graduate program in Mining Engineering has two types of students in mind:
Those from industry who wish to improve their workplace skills; and
Those who wish to pursue research leading to advances in state-of-the-art or state-of-the-practice mining and mineral process engineering.
In order to best meet the needs of these two groups, the program encourages interaction between universities in North America and other countries. In many cases, this collaborative outlook leads to joint research projects and student exchanges.
For specific program requirements, please refer to the departmental program website
What makes the program unique?
opportunities for interdisciplinary work on social, economic as well as engineering research
international research opportunities
travel opportunities
connections to CIRDI
Vancouver is a centre for Mining Activity in Canada with its abundance of junior mining companies, finance for mining companies, and law for mining companies.
I chose UBC because of the high standard of academic training available combined with access to world-class professors and teaching staff. Also, studying in one of the top-ranked universities in the world, surrounded by the ocean and mountains, was my dream.

Research Facilities
Our facilities are specifically designed to ensure that our faculty, staff and students are prepared to meet the demands on the mining industry. Our instructional building, the Frank Forward building and our research facility, the Coal & Mineral Processing Laboratory, are fully equipped to provide a positive research and educational framework. Much of the equipment has been obtained through the generosity of donors and the initiative of faculty who seek out and obtain research grants. As a result, the UBC Department of Mining Engineering is able to maintain its’ reputation for producing first rate mining engineers and research. In 2003 we underwent a major renovation that gave us a state-of-the-art classroom, a larger conference room, and a redesigned main office that includes more work space, quiet nooks, and a coffee room.

* Regular, full-time tuition. For on-leave, extension, continuing or part time (if applicable) fees see
UBC Calendar
.
All fees for the year are subject to adjustment and UBC reserves the right to change any fees without notice at any time, including tuition and student fees. Tuition fees are reviewed annually by the UBC Board of Governors. In recent years, tuition increases have been 2% for continuing domestic students and between 2% and 5% for continuing international students. New students may see higher increases in tuition. Admitted students who defer their admission are subject to the potentially higher tuition fees for incoming students effective at the later program start date. In case of a discrepancy between this webpage and the UBC Calendar, the UBC Calendar entry will be held to be correct.
Financial Support
Applicants to UBC have access to a variety of funding options, including merit-based (i.e. based on your academic performance) and need-based (i.e. based on your financial situation) opportunities.
Program Funding Packages
Some types of financial assistance are available for the winter session and may be supplemented by summer research and/or teaching assistantships to the registered students.
Financial support for non-Canadian students is limited and high academic standings are required to obtain support [Grade Point Averages exceeding 3.7 (maximum 4)].
We suggest that you have financial support to finance at least the first year of studies.  In the event that a sponsor is willing to provide you with financial support, we will require a letter from him/her noting the amount of financial aid available and its duration.
We regret that we cannot process your application without this document.  The department will not be responsible for foreign students’ financial.
The University of British Columbia may offer a Partial Tuition Scholarship up to $3,200 each year to help defray the very large tuition fee increase that has recently levied on foreign students.
Scholarships & awards (merit-based funding)
All applicants are encouraged to review the
awards listing
to identify potential opportunities to fund their graduate education. The database lists merit-based scholarships and awards and allows for filtering by various criteria, such as domestic vs. international or degree level.
Graduate Research Assistantships (GRA)
Many professors are able to provide Research Assistantships (GRA) from their research grants to support full-time graduate students studying under their supervision. The duties constitute part of the student's graduate degree requirements. A Graduate Research Assistantship is considered a form of fellowship for a period of graduate study and is therefore not covered by a collective agreement. Stipends vary widely, and are dependent on the field of study and the type of research grant from which the assistantship is being funded.
Graduate Teaching Assistantships (GTA)
Graduate programs may have Teaching Assistantships available for registered full-time graduate students. Full teaching assistantships involve 12 hours work per week in preparation, lecturing, or laboratory instruction although many graduate programs offer partial TA appointments at less than 12 hours per week. Teaching assistantship rates are set by collective bargaining between the University and the
Teaching Assistants' Union
.
Graduate Academic Assistantships (GAA)
Academic Assistantships are employment opportunities to perform work that is relevant to the university or to an individual faculty member, but not to support the student’s graduate research and thesis. Wages are considered regular earnings and when paid monthly, include vacation pay.
Financial aid (need-based funding)
Canadian and US applicants may qualify for governmental loans to finance their studies. Please review
eligibility and types of loans
.
All students may be able to access private sector or bank loans.
Foreign government scholarships
Many foreign governments provide support to their citizens in pursuing education abroad. International applicants should check the various governmental resources in their home country, such as the Department of Education, for available scholarships.
Working while studying
The possibility to pursue work to supplement income may depend on the demands the program has on students. It should be carefully weighed if work leads to prolonged program durations or whether work placements can be meaningfully embedded into a program.
International students enrolled as full-time students with a valid study permit can work
on campus
for unlimited hours and work
off-campus
for no more than 20 hours a week.
A good starting point to explore student jobs is the UBC
Work Learn
program or a
Co-Op placement
.
Tax credits and RRSP withdrawals
Students with taxable income in Canada may be able to claim
federal
or
provincial
tax credits.
Canadian residents with RRSP accounts may be able to use the
Lifelong Learning Plan
(LLP) which allows students to withdraw amounts from their registered retirement savings plan (RRSPs) to finance full-time training or education for themselves or their partner.
Please review
Filing taxes in Canada
on the student services website for more information.
Cost Estimator
Applicants have access to the
cost estimator
to develop a financial plan that takes into account various income sources and expenses.
Career Options
Graduates can go into academia as well as engineering industry, such as a technical expert for a mining company, consutling company or supply company; mining industry advisor for financial and banking etc.
