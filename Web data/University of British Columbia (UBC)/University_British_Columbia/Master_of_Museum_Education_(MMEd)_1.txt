Overview
The term museum encompasses a broad range of organisations with a focus on learning in settings outside the traditional classroom.  Museums include cultural centres, science centres, historic sites, parks, planetaria, art museums and art galleries.  Contemporary museum education establishes museums as innovative learning environments rather than repositories of artefacts. As museums and other informal learning sites contemplate new roles within society it will be incumbent upon museum professionals, and particularly museum educators, to become catalysts for different ways of thinking about the educational roles and potentials of museums and other informal learning sites, teaching and learning in museum settings as well as exploring new relationships between museums and the broader community.
This is a part-time program that is offered 90% online and 10% in face to face sessions.
For specific program requirements, please refer to the departmental program website
What makes the program unique?
Unlike many museum studies degree programs that tend to focus on the conservation and preservation of artifacts in object-based museums the MMED's focus is on the scholarship of education in museum settings and the practices needed to help museums achieve their educational mission.

All fees for the year are subject to adjustment and UBC reserves the right to change any fees without notice at any time, including tuition and student fees. Tuition fees are reviewed annually by the UBC Board of Governors. In recent years, tuition increases have been 2% for continuing domestic students and between 2% and 5% for continuing international students. New students may see higher increases in tuition.

Working while studying
The possibility to pursue work to supplement income may depend on the demands the program has on students. It should be carefully weighed if work leads to prolonged program durations or whether work placements can be meaningfully embedded into a program.
