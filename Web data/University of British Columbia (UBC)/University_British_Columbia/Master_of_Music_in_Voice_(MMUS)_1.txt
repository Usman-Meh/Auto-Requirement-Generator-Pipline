Overview
The Master of Music (M.Mus.) degree in Voice performance is offered to students who have achieved necessary levels of attainment and productivity at the undergraduate level, and who give reasonable promise of further significant accomplishment. This degree is often a final academic performance step for the musician who wishes to enter the professional world, although it may prove an intermediate step for those wishing to prepare for doctoral training. Performance candidates present a recital in lieu of a thesis. A two-year residency is the norm.
For specific program requirements, please refer to the departmental program website
What makes the program unique?
The Voice department offers many performance and study opportunities. In past years, we have held masterclasses with prestigious alumni like Ben Heppner, Judith Forst, and David Agler, Renée Fleming, Sondra Radvanovsky, Angela Meade, Eric Owens, Luca Pisaroni and Jane Archibald.as well as a host of other fine performers, coaches and conductors.
Voice performance Majors will work intensively with Prof. Rena Sharon, Dr. Terrence Dawson and other Voice faculty members in their preparations for their recital performances or special events. Opportunities to participate in Chamber music and Small Ensembles such as Contemporary Players and the Early Music Ensemble are also possible and encouraged.
Students in the M.Mus. in Voice Performance are also encouraged to participate in the Opera Workshop to broaden their experience. Students should contact Prof. Hermiston, Chair of Voice and Opera Divisions if they are interested.
The thesis for the M.Mus. students in Voice Performance is a one-hour recital The thesis solo recital is normally performed in the second year. We highly recommend that the student use their first-year jury which will consist of thirty minutes of solo repertoire as a recital opportunity as well. Please note that only one Opera or Oratorio aria may be performed in a 30 min. recital. In a full one- hour recital one oratorio and one opera aria are allowed. Each program proposal should be accompanied by a short rationale describing the idea(s) or theme(s) for the recital and/or reasonings for the choice of repertoire. Considerable thought should be given to this, and the result should not be a random selection of works. The two recitals together should display a varied and balanced repertoire, encompassing a wide-range of works acceptable to the committee. The rationale/comments may also be spoken from the stage.
Graduate students maintain continuous registration, and may perform recitals at any time with the approval and availability of their individual committee members.

Admission Information & Requirements
Program Instructions
An audition, either in-person or via video, is required.
We strongly encourage applicants to do an in-person audition. This facilitates the student to actually see the faculty members with whom they will be working, the facilities, if possible an in -person lesson with some of the teachers and a general feel for the university as a whole.
It also helps the committee to get to have a personal contact with the student, hear them in one of the venues in which they will perform and promotes an in-person conversation between both student and professors.
We realize that an in-person audition is sometimes not possible and are also open to video applications. Please ensure that the video is of a high quality, showing you at your best.

Research Information
Research Highlights
M.Mus. students in Voice Performance are welcome to become part of our research efforts if they are interested in this area.
The Opera Program is linked with research conducted by a team formed by Opera Director, Nancy Hermiston. It consists of some of UBC’s finest researchers, Dr. Janet Werker, Dr. Lara Boyd and Dr. Rachel Weber and two outstanding Postdoctoral students, Dr. Anja Xiaoxing-Cui and Dr. Negin Motamed Yeganeh. In the current study we are considering the effects of opera training on neuropsychological functions in opera trainees before and after an intensive participation in the Opera Workshop Course in which they prepare and professionally stage a full opera over a course of three-month segments during the year. We hypothesized that participation in this workshop would lead to increased executive function, attention, and verbal and visual memory. We further explore the neural underpinnings of any changes through the analysis of brain anatomy.
Research Focus
An undergraduate course in Pedagogy is available and the possibility for intensive research at the graduate level is always possible through special research projects. Collaboration with the Pacific Voice Clinic is possible.
Research into Canadian song repertoire is strongly encouraged since many UBC professors and Alumni have been famous composers of art song. We also encourage a multi-media approach to the recital experience. Investigations into works of unknown composers past and present is also encouraged as well as bringing an outstanding performance of traditional recital works back to the stage.
Research Facilities
From the state-of-the-art Chan Centre for Performing Arts, one of North America's premier musical venues, to the historic Old Auditorium and intimate Roy Barnett Recital Hall, you will have the opportunity to train and grow as a professional musician in front of diverse audiences.

* Regular, full-time tuition. For on-leave, extension, continuing or part time (if applicable) fees see
UBC Calendar
.
All fees for the year are subject to adjustment and UBC reserves the right to change any fees without notice at any time, including tuition and student fees. Tuition fees are reviewed annually by the UBC Board of Governors. In recent years, tuition increases have been 2% for continuing domestic students and between 2% and 5% for continuing international students. New students may see higher increases in tuition. Admitted students who defer their admission are subject to the potentially higher tuition fees for incoming students effective at the later program start date. In case of a discrepancy between this webpage and the UBC Calendar, the UBC Calendar entry will be held to be correct.
Financial Support
Applicants to UBC have access to a variety of funding options, including merit-based (i.e. based on your academic performance) and need-based (i.e. based on your financial situation) opportunities.
Program Funding Packages
Students admitted to the School of Music’s graduate programs are automatically considered for scholarships under the GSI (Graduate Support Initiative) program. These competitive awards typically range from $1,000 to 12,000 and are guaranteed for two to four years.
Scholarships & awards (merit-based funding)
All applicants are encouraged to review the
awards listing
to identify potential opportunities to fund their graduate education. The database lists merit-based scholarships and awards and allows for filtering by various criteria, such as domestic vs. international or degree level.
Graduate Research Assistantships (GRA)
Many professors are able to provide Research Assistantships (GRA) from their research grants to support full-time graduate students studying under their supervision. The duties constitute part of the student's graduate degree requirements. A Graduate Research Assistantship is considered a form of fellowship for a period of graduate study and is therefore not covered by a collective agreement. Stipends vary widely, and are dependent on the field of study and the type of research grant from which the assistantship is being funded.
Graduate Teaching Assistantships (GTA)
Graduate programs may have Teaching Assistantships available for registered full-time graduate students. Full teaching assistantships involve 12 hours work per week in preparation, lecturing, or laboratory instruction although many graduate programs offer partial TA appointments at less than 12 hours per week. Teaching assistantship rates are set by collective bargaining between the University and the
Teaching Assistants' Union
.
Graduate Academic Assistantships (GAA)
Academic Assistantships are employment opportunities to perform work that is relevant to the university or to an individual faculty member, but not to support the student’s graduate research and thesis. Wages are considered regular earnings and when paid monthly, include vacation pay.
Financial aid (need-based funding)
Canadian and US applicants may qualify for governmental loans to finance their studies. Please review
eligibility and types of loans
.
All students may be able to access private sector or bank loans.
Foreign government scholarships
Many foreign governments provide support to their citizens in pursuing education abroad. International applicants should check the various governmental resources in their home country, such as the Department of Education, for available scholarships.
Working while studying
The possibility to pursue work to supplement income may depend on the demands the program has on students. It should be carefully weighed if work leads to prolonged program durations or whether work placements can be meaningfully embedded into a program.
International students enrolled as full-time students with a valid study permit can work
on campus
for unlimited hours and work
off-campus
for no more than 20 hours a week.
A good starting point to explore student jobs is the UBC
Work Learn
program or a
Co-Op placement
.
Tax credits and RRSP withdrawals
Students with taxable income in Canada may be able to claim
federal
or
provincial
tax credits.
Canadian residents with RRSP accounts may be able to use the
Lifelong Learning Plan
(LLP) which allows students to withdraw amounts from their registered retirement savings plan (RRSPs) to finance full-time training or education for themselves or their partner.
Please review
Filing taxes in Canada
on the student services website for more information.
Cost Estimator
Applicants have access to the
cost estimator
