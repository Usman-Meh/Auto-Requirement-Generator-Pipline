Overview
This course chooses to invest in an interdisciplinary approach extending beyond the foundations given in the first cycle degrees, based on proximity and succession of professional and sociological subjects.
Here, right in first year there is a close comparison among sociological subjects, purposefully specific and not theoretical (Social Issues, Family and Local Welfare Services Policies) psychological subjects not limiting to the juvenile stages (Psychology of the Life Span), professional subjects (Biography, Social Culture and Services – another subject equally focussing on life span), specific economical subjects (Economy of Social Intervention) and political-philosophical ones that enable students to produce thought-out judgement in social politics (Theories of Justice and Social Intervention).
In both years of the course a theme that crosses the entire curriculum is the enhancement of the verification and evaluation phases of social intervention. Great importance is also given to all subjects dedicated to the study of management control, auditing and working of local welfare systems. At the same time law subjects are focussed on the core topics of the course (Civil Law of Minors, Special Penal and Minors Law).
In the second year of the course the burden of the exams becomes lighter, with a political science subject purposefully empirical, focussing on local governments and inter-institutional relations (Local Policies) and the choice of two advanced subjects in sociology. This and a consistent number of elective subjects leave room for the internship, the second year seminar and the dissertation write up. In this manner the curriculum further  develops its interdisciplinary approach already established by the compulsory subjects and opens to further knowledge on subjects pertinent to the dissertation or of interest to the student.
