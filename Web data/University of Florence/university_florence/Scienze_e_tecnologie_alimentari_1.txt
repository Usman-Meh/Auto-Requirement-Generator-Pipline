Overview
The Master’s Degree Course aims to provide advanced knowledge and develop appropriate professional skills to perform complex coordination, management and design activities within production, control and marketing organisations in the agri-food sector. The course also aims to provide advanced knowledge and develop professional skills to guarantee food quality other than the safety component.
These aims translate into the specific objective of providing the basic information and operation tools to tackle and solve problems related to evaluating and improving the quality of food products and relevant production processes from a systemic-holistic vision and supply-chain perspective. Graduates will be able to implement quality and innovation through their ability to: define and monitor the product in relation to community and business expectations; define and monitor the most appropriate production process in order to achieve a given product; define and monitor suitable raw materials for the production process.
Students will be provided with numerous application skills of acquired knowledge. These include management skills oriented towards study and research of business and marketing strategies; skills focused on retrieving, understanding and updating food law; ability to control and manage both acceptability and preference tests, as well as data analysis and interpretation skills to estimate the effect of physiological, psychological and cognitive aspects affecting responses; ability to design a production process with regard to appropriate raw materials, production operations, necessary equipment and plants, including key parts of production process control systems for system and product certification; ability both to carry out microbiological techniques for identifying and measuring microorganisms in food products and to control the microbial component in food production.
