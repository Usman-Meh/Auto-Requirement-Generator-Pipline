Overview
Forest ecosystems play a key role in biomass production, hydrogeological protection and environmental quality assurance. Forests are also biodiversity-rich habitats that contribute to wildlife conservation and actively participate in climate change mitigation processes. Wood production, which is the goal of traditional forest management, is becoming increasingly valuable both for the development of alternative and renewable energy sources and as an ecologically sustainable construction material with great potential. The multifunctional values that today are recognized to forests make them crucial elements in the context of territorial policies, which require a cognitive management approach, able to fully integrate biological, socio-economic and technological aspects.
The MSc (Laurea Magistrale) program in Science and Technology of Forest Systems of the University of Florence promotes research and professional training in the sectors of management and conservation of forest ecosystems, wood production and wood technology. The training aims to provide students with the ability to address complex problems in the planning, management and conservation of forest ecosystems, in the organization of the supply chain production and in the technological enhancement of wood products.
The mission of the MSc course is to educate and train experts in the field of forestry sciences with specialized knowledge and technical skills to deal, in a sustainable and environmentally sound manner, with the protection, management and conservation of forest ecosystems; the planning, economic evaluation and analysis of forest production processes; land management and landscape enhancement; the organization, improvement and innovation of forest production and the entire chain of woody and non-woody forest products; land defense and land instability management and restoration.
Career opportunities
The MSc program is designed for the training of technical experts of natural resources able to operate at the national and international level, with functions of high responsibility, in public and private bodies and companies, in development agencies, in the wood industry, in companies involved in processing and marketing forest products, in companies or bodies responsible for qualification, certification, conservation of products derived from wood, as well as in the management and safeguard of urban forests. The course prepares graduates for freelance activity, because the degree in Science and Technology of Forest Systems allows access to the Professional Register of Agronomists and Foresters (section A). Graduates can participate in competitions for the recruitment of officers of the State Forestry Corps. The course provides preparation for entering a PhD program and for pursuing a career in scientific research.
