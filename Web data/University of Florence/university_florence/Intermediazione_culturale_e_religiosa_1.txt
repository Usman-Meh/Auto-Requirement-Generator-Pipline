Overview

LMC
lass 64, Science of Religions – while maintaining the basic characteristics of the class to which it belongs, aims to innovate the tradition of studies by proposing an intercultural and interreligious educational approach. The Master’s Degree trains graduates with knowledge and skills relating to the world’s most important religious areas, providing skills immediately applicable in many contexts characterized by interculturality and functional to design the mediation strategies between members of different religious and identity traditions. The mediation strategies must be strategies of inclusion, which are deployed thanks to education for complexity, using historical knowledge as elements capable of weakening the practices of exclusion and marginalization carried out using prejudice and fake news as well as by the silence.
Qualifying aspects of the course are: the interdisciplinary and systemic approach to the study of intercultural and interreligious phenomena; the experiential component (guaranteed by laboratories and traineeship, the attention to intervention and training methodologies; the importance of the anthropological approach to religious and cultural phenomena (guaranteed by the presence of a 12
CFU
Cultural Anthropology course); the study of religious traditions in history; the importance of Pedagogy and Sociology, as attested by the presence of these disciplines among the subjects offered; the presence of Workshops and Internships carried out in close collaboration with the Social Partners, in order to provide students with the necessary techniques of mediation and communication (Workshops) and to place them in a context of experimental action, within which they will have to act on the basis of knowledge and skills acquired during the cursus studiorum (Traineeship.
The proposed training course trains experts in intercultural and interreligious mediation who can design, plan and implement training and intercultural and interreligious mediation in public and private training agencies, in private companies and in organizations and bodies where an intercultural and interreligious approach to internal or external users is required.

ATTENDANCE
, infra]
There are two semesters per academic year, for a total of 120
CFU
(60
CFU
per year). The first year comprises mainly academic subjects characterizing of Master’s Degree (cultural anthropology, history of religions, sociologies) and the pedagogies linked to these subjects (intercultural and interreligious pedagogy).
- During the first year there are educational activities that strengthen the basic tools and subjects that have propaedeutic characteristics compared to the others. So the student matures and consolidates his knowledge of the anthropological method, with which he will have to learn how to approach the multireligious and multicultural phenomena, and then tackle the history of religions and the history of Christianity and the churches in a way of teaching that highlights their plurality. After that, the student will find teaching on several cultural and religious contexts, from which he should choose to explore those of particular interest. He will find also a teaching on the area of non-belief. The 6
CFU
relating to additional linguistic knowledge must then be chosen in line with the cultural and religious contexts chosen by the student. After that, the History of International Relations and/or the History of Africa and the intercultural pedagogical systems courses are planned. Students may decide whether to complete their knowledge by studying the dynamics of linguistic phenomena in greater depth, or whether they prefer to develop their knowledge of material and non-material cultural heritage as an intercultural and interreligious medium (art), thus perfecting their knowledge of material cultural heritage as a place of interculturality, which is at the heart of the Cultural Anthropology course.
- In the second year, students will complete and specialize their training by tackling the major philosophical and gnoseological frameworks of reference, but placing them within their respective historical contexts. Then they will be able to measure themselves against legal systems and political philosophy and will be able to decide whether to continue to perfect their knowledge of heritage as a place of interculturality by means of the art history courses or whether to refine the dynamics of linguistic phenomena with the sociology of cultural and communicative processes course. Finally, the workshops and internships – organized and managed in collaboration with the Social Partners- guarantee the technical training of the student, who will learn to measure himself “with” and “to manage” concrete situations.
