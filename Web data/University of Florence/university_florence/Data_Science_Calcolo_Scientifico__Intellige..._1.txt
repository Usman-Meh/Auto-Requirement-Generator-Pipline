Overview
The Master’s Degree Course in
Data Science, Calcolo Scientifico & Intelligenza Artificiale (taught in Italian)
intends to provide a degree course in a certainly emerging sector such as that of data science and scientific computing. In fact, the profession of Data Scientist is naturally emerging as one of the most sought professions on the market and the demand significantly exceeds the actual availability of these figures. The course of study therefore has the objective of training professional figures capable of answering research questions arising from the pervasive presence of complex data, both structured and unstructured, and of high dimensionality (so-called big data) in the most varied fields of application; in particular, in scientific fields of an interdisciplinary nature involving biology, chemistry, physics, and geology.
This objective is achieved through the acquisition of solid theoretical and practical skills in various fields of computer science, mathematics and statistics and their application through various paths declined in the various scientific fields, including those of in-depth study of computer science and mathematics for data science, scientific computing and artificial intelligence.
Programme structure
The Degree Course is divided into 2 years for a total of 120 credits (
ECTS
) and normally the student’s activity corresponds to the achievement of 60
CFU
per year. The following types of training activities are foreseen:
27 credits caratterizzanti of mathematical-statistical training;
27 credits caratterizzanti of computer science training;
6 credits  caratterizzanti of  legal-linguistic training;
18 credits affini of training;
18 credits  self-chosen by the student;
24 credits for the final exam and further training activities.
In order to enhance the heterogeneity of incoming students, the study program offers diversified  activities of typology caratterizzante and a wide range of activities of typology affine on emerging Data Science topics.
