Overview
The Master’s Degree Program in “Statistics and data science” is active from academic year 2019/20. It is a transformation of “Statistics, Actuarial and Financial Sciences”. The main novelties concern:
an increase in data science contents, in particular with the activation of a fundamental course of computer science (“Algorithms and programming for data analysis”), the addition of computational issues to the basic course of statistical inference, the strengthening of Bayesian statistics with the activation of a fundamental course in the first year.
The major emphasis on data science is motivated by the excellent job opportunities of graduates with these skills and by the current research activity of the reference department to which almost all the teachers of the degree programme belong, ie the Department of Statistics, Computer Science, Applications. G. Parenti ‘, which obtained a loan for the five-year period 2018-2022 as a department of excellence with a project on data science topics.
Career opportunities
The master program prepares statisticians for a broad range of careers, particularly in the financial, medical, pharmaceutical and industrial sectors of the economy, but also with local and national government agencies, as well as in other areas. The master program also provides an excellent foundation for students wishing to pursue advanced postgraduate research in statistics.
