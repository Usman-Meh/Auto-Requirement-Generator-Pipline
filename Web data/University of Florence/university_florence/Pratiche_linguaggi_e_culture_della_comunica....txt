Overview
The aim of the course is to provide students with knowledge and skills able to endow them with a theoretical and professional know-how specialized in all of the issues and dynamics of Communication that – especially today – make it a strategically crucial ground for our economic, social and political life.
The solidity of the curriculum and its openly multidisciplinary profile (ranging from the sociology of cultural processes to linguistics, from philosophical knowledge to pedagogical training) aim to train experts in communication processes able to look beyond the most ephemeral fashions and to be ready for changes in market strategy. Also for this reason, the Degree Course is particularly attentive to the virtuous interweaving of educational communication and communication training. Thus, the skills to be acquired in the conception, design and implementation of models of integration between training knowledge and communication are considered essential tools for anyone who aspires to be professionally involved in the field of communication.
Through an appropriate interaction between the framework of the Disciplinary Courses and the Laboratories devoted to technological-multimedia research, the Degree Course seeks more specifically to enable students to acquire competences related to: knowledge of the broad spectrum of social theories of communication; mastery of texts and of technological-multimedia and linguistic-communicational grammars; knowledge of infrastructural and operational components of information and communication technologies; knowledge of methodologies suitable for the design and management of communication systems; conception, design, development and management of editorial projects and products with particular attention to the social dynamics of fruition; the design of studies and research activities on network architectures and their social, cultural and technological development; the design of educational paths, with particular attention to distance learning; the scientific planning of communication models useful for the realization of communicative prototypes at different levels and for different fields; the conception, design and management of educational processes, particularly within the field of communication.
Programme structure
The Master Degree takes 2 years and requires the acquisition of 120 credits, 18 of which are part of the final examination. The education of full-time students normally requires the acquisition of 60 credits per year. The student who obtains 102 credits as required by the didactic structure is allowed to take the final examination. For each subject an achievement test is expected.
The program consists of a multidisciplinary course that provides the theoretical and practical basis of communication science over the first year, and a detailed study of the main theoretical models of communication over the second year. This is achieved through an integrated approach that aims to ensure the acquisition of accurate skills in those scientific sectors that are necessary to analyze and create communication processes, and to promote conception and creation activities and the realization of communication objects through the application of the main design techniques of those communication objects, paying specific attention to the grammars of communicative technologies.
Career opportunities
Students that graduate in Pratiche, linguaggi e culture della comunicazione will be able to elaborate on and coordinate editorial projects (for experts in newspapers and information agencies; and professionals in traditional and multimedia publishing fields); they will have solid skills in defining and managing educational processes in all those sectors that involve Education; in particular Communication Education (for professionals in the fields of services, personnel management, and human resources). This degree enables students to use their knowledge in Research (in the public, private, and non-profit sectors), in Information and Communication Economy (from publishing to telecommunications), in the Communication departments of private and public institutions (from press to communication offices) and, in general, in all those activities that require advanced skills in analyzing, creating, organizing, managing, and realizing innovative products and formats for Information and Communication.
