Overview
The Master’s Degree Course in Energy Engineering trains high-level professionals with a mastery of analytical and numerical modelling methods and general technical and scientific content in engineering in specific fields such as energy plant engineering, machine design in energy conversion and propulsion systems and their integration with electrical systems and machines. The level of in-depth study of the topics dealt with during the training course characterizes the Master’s Degree for a high technical-cultural preparation in the different fields of energy, and gives him the ability to deal with complex problems, even according to an interdisciplinary approach, aimed specifically at innovation.
He is aware of and able to assume responsibility for the roles he holds. The students of the master’s degree are prepared to cover, with greater skills, responsibility and autonomy, the roles, characterized by typical skills of ‘energy engineering, for which they were trained by the three-year degree in industry and in particular in mechanical and electrical engineering and whose related teachings are considered essential requirements for access to the master’s degree. These implementations are obtained in the course of the compulsory examinations or through an adequate selection of exams of restricted or free choice to complete the individual study plan.
Career opportunities
The typical professional areas for graduate specialists of the course are those of innovation and development of production, advanced design, planning and scheduling, management of complex systems, both in the profession in manufacturing or service companies and in public administrations. The graduates of the course will find employment at:
- companies and bodies for the production, conversion and management of energy;
- plant engineering companies;
- manufacturing companies in general for the production, installation and testing, maintenance and management of thermal machines and propulsion systems, auxiliary systems for the management and conversion of energy, production lines and departments in the manufacturing sectors of energy engineering and complex systems;
- mechanical, electromechanical and electrical industries.
