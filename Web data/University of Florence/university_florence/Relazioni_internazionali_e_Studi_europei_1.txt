Overview
Presentation of the Master’s programme in International Relations and European Studies
The Master’s Degree in International Relations and European Studies (
RISE
) is an interclass course: it is organised in two degree classes: International Relations (LM-52) and European Studies (LM-90).
The two tracks have a marked multi and to some extent inter-disciplinary connotation, in line with the tradition of international studies at the “Cesare Alfieri” School of Political Science. This study programme aims to provide students with the skills and abilities to develop a holistic view of the political, social and economic phenomena of the contemporary international arena.
In this perspective,
RISE
, through ad hoc selection, offers some students the possibility of obtaining a double degree. The agreement with the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (
MGIMO
) aims at defining a shared educational path. More recently, two agreements with other prominent foreign universities have been signed: the Gdansk University of Technology (Master in Economic Analysis, specialisation in Global Studies) and the Tong Ji University of Shanghai (Master in International Relations, International Politics, and Diplomacy). All three agreements allow selected students to obtain a double degree between the University of Florence and the partner universities.
An additional opportunity for
RISE
students is a study track in English which, in addition to deepening the international topics of the Master’s degree, offers the possibility of acquiring specific skills in English in the various fields.
Career opportunities
Graduates of the
RISE
Master’s programme gain a sound background of professional knowledge and skills to pursue a wide range of international careers.
