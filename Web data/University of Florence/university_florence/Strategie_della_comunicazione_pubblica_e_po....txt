Overview
The Master’s degree in Public and Political Communication Strategies starting from a.y. 2012-2013 offers a newly conceived programme.
The new educational project has its roots in the long-standing, positive experience of the Master Course in “Strategic Communication” but at the same time it widens its scope by adding new teachings and new disciplinary areas.
The structure of the new degree has as one of its main objectives to strengthen the multidisciplinary approach – a prerequisite for the new professional profiles in communications and to concentrate its educational focus on the centrality of communication in this day and age with particular reference to institutions and politics.
