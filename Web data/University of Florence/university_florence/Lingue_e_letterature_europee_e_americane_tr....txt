Overview
The Master’s Degree in European and American Languages and Literatures offers students the possibility to choose among the following curricula:
- Languages, Literatures and Translation, aimed to train graduates with specific skills in European and Euro-American literatures, languages and cultures, either acquiring the requirements to access the ‘Classi di concorso’ to enter the teaching profession or gaining skills in translating literary texts.
Students will gain an in-depth knowledge of two Euro-American languages, literatures and cultures, and translation skills, also attending translation workshops and analysing both literary and scientific texts (economic, tourist, administrative-legal, media, etc.).
Graduates will also gain expertise in documenting, writing, editing and revising texts, as well as using digital tools required by a career in the publishing sector.
The program prepares students to work as experts in institutes of international, cultural and economic cooperation, and to work for Italian cultural institutions in Italy and abroad. They will be able to work as experts not only in the literary publishing field, but also in the advertising and multimedia. They can also work as linguistic collaborators in industry and the advanced service sector.
- Linguistic and philological studies (monolingual), aimed to train students in metalinguistic reflections and critical-textual analysis, both by acquiring the main descriptive and theoretical tools in Linguistics in its various declinations (theoretical-formal, diachronic-comparative, functional), as well as the methods of analysis of linguistic phenomena (morphosyntax, lexicon, phonetics and phonology, etc.), such as native and second language acquisition. Students will also learn the linguistic mechanisms of communication, both by studying the principles of textual-critical analysis of texts and textual criticism. The Digital Culture Lab will also enable students to acquire further knowledge in the field of digital texts editing and publication, and processing corpora. Students will potentially be able to secure positions of high responsibility in the field of intellectual, scientific and highly specialized professions, for instance, as humanities, social sciences and management experts, researchers, and educators.
They will be able to interact as experts in the field of cultural services in both public and private companies at national and international level, as well as consultants and collaborators in medical activity and research related to language skills (speech therapy, audiology, speech rehabilitation, neurolinguistics).
Finally, they will be able to meet the requirements to access the “Classi di concorso” for teaching.
