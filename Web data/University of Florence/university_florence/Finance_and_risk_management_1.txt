Overview
The MSc in Finance and Risk Management offers its prospective students an advanced education in finance, quantitative risk management, actuarial sciences, banking and financial accounting.
The course is a combination of economic theory for finance with quantitative methods (probability theory, statistics, numerical analysis and computational methods) to quantify and manage risk arising from financial, economic and insurance applications.
The MSc mix theory and practice, academic lectures and interaction with finance and insurance practitioners and empirical sessions.
In the first year, with the common track, you will acquire an in-depth grounding with core courses from corporate finance,  financial markets and institutions, quantitative and computational finance.
In the second year, you can deepen your knowledge and  tailor the degree to your goals both by taking one of the three offered tracks – corporate finance and banking, insurance and risk management, quantitative finance – and by moving forward one of the three Double Degrees opportunities.
With the DD Msc Finance and Accounting with School of Economics in Varsaw you will deepen your knowledge in corporate finance and financial accountability, while the DD in  Quantitative Asset and Risk Management at the University of Economics in Katowice will provide you an in-depth knowledge of asset management and risk management. Finally, if your curiosity is for FinTech, the DD in Engineering and Finance with the École Nationale Supérieure d’Informatique pour l’Industrie et l’Enterprise – Paris-Evry,  will give you the opportunity to study financial data analysis, machine learning, block chain and computing languages.
