are required to have a valid certificat of Italian language proficiency at
level B2
awarded as determined by the
CLIQ
(Italian Quality Language Certification) quality system, which unites in one association the current certification bodies (University for Foreigners of Perugia, University for Foreigners of Siena, Rome Tre University and the Dante Alighieri Society) and University for Foreigners “Dante Alighieri” of Reggio Calabria, as well as in convention with Italian Institutes of Culture abroad or other institutions.
These certifications may be gained in the country of origin, in the approved exam centres found all over the world.
Applicants which do not hold any certificate of Italian language can participate in the test that is annually organized by the University. More information are available

Overview
Informatics Engineering (LM-32, B070)
The Master’s Degree Program in Informatics Engineering trains professionals to advanced technical and scientific levels. Graduates are capable of applying state-of-the-art analysis and design methods, and are able to formulate and algorithmically treat complex information processing problems. These skills are combined with a concrete mastery of information technologies and processes that characterize their practice in production — often in multidisciplinary areas with a high degree of innovation.
The depth of study in the topics covered characterizes graduates of the Master’s Program with a high degree of technical/cultural preparedness in the various fields of Informatics Engineering,  and in particular in four areas of specialization offered in the program:
Multimedia Systems
Advanced Computing
Big Data and Distributed Systems
Computing Systems and Networks.
Multimedia Systems
. At the end of this course of specialization graduates will be familiar with models for the representation, processing, and analysis of documents, images, videos and 3D objects; they will have the ability to design, optimize and develop modules for the analysis, authentication, encryption and visualization in graphic forms of such content for graphical interfaces exploiting natural interaction, virtual reality systems, and augmented reality; and they will be able to integrate these various technologies in complex systems.
Advanced Computing
. At the end of this course of specialization graduates will be able to apply and develop advanced information processing solutions combining methods of artificial intelligence, optimization, evaluation, and verification of models. They will also have the ability to apply software engineering methods to design and develop complex yet reliable software systems that integrate information processing components and distributed cyber-physical components.
Big Data and Distributed Systems
. At the end of this course of specialization graduates will have mastered models and technologies for the realization of distributed, dynamic software systems endowed with intelligence and great complexity; they will have the ability to design and develop modules for the processing of information and data in real time and in batches; and they will be able to integrate modules for the creation of scalable, flexible and highly resilient systems.
Computing Systems and Networks
. At the end of this course of specialization graduates will be able to understand and contribute to the technological evolution of the Computer Science and Networks sector through the application of machine learning and automatic controls methodologies. They will also have acquired in-depth knowledge of next-generation telecommunications networks, techniques for control and virtualization of network functions for distributed computing, as well as network security and IoT technologies.
