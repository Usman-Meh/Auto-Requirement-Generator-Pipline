Overview
Introduction to the course
In less than a decade, Artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to radically and pervasively transform industry and society, and the implications of these changes are profound, far-reaching, and destined to continue into the future. The growth of interest in AI has been explosive in both the scientific and industrial worlds. The Master’s Degree Program (Laurea Magistrale) in Artificial Intelligence Engineering has the ambitious goal of training high-level professionals on two synergistic and complementary levels. From a technical and engineering point of view, the aim is to provide advanced vertical skills in current technologies. From a scientific and methodological point of view, the aim is to provide the horizontal skills that will allow graduates to evolve and to contribute to the long-term growth of the sector.
Identity of the course
The applications of AI are many and often require adaptability to multidisciplinary contexts and an approach to the discipline open to different visions. A strength of the University of Florence is that it is home to scholars in Informatics Engineering who, with their networks of collaborations, have contributed significantly for many years to the development of important areas of AI: machine learning, computer vision, technologies for automatic media interpretation, and optimization. At the same time, the University of Florence has a Department of Excellence in Statistics, whose synergy with computer science is essential for the continued development of AI. The identity of the Master’s Program is completed by scholars in the areas of cognitive neuroscience, physics applied to quantum computing and machine learning, and jurisprudence related to the ethical and social implications of the transformations that AI requires us to face.
Mission
The mission of the Master’s Program in Artificial Intelligence Engineering is to train analysts and designers of intelligent systems in strategic areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, logistics, market data analysis, automation, and intelligent diagnostics. Graduates are characterized by an advanced technical/cultural preparation in a broad spectrum of subjects and with the ability to quickly integrate into leading-edge design and production contexts. Given the enormous interest in scientific research in AI from both academia and industry, the Master’s Program will favor the best and brightest by encouraging them to continue their formation with PhD-level studies.
Career opportunities
The Master’s Program in AI Engineering trains engineers capable of entering the workforce as analysts and designers of software components aimed at the many application areas of AI. Important examples of application areas are:
● Artificial vision: components aimed at the analysis, interpretation and generation of images and videos;
● Natural language: where data has a significant textual component;
● Decision support systems: modules analyzing information relevant to the optimized management of production, inventory, procurement, and distribution processes.
● Market data analysis: systeme based on predictive analysis techniques used for dynamic pricing and personalized advertising.
● Automation of plants and processes: modules for diagnostics and predictive maintenance, where AI improves the efficiency and safety of production processes.
Graduates will be able to grow in their companies until one day assuming coordination or management roles.
