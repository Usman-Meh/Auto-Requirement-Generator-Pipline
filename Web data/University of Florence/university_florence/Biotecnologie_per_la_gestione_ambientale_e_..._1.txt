Italian
Non-EU applicants living abroad
are required to have a valid certificat of Italian language proficiency at
level B2
awarded as determined by the
CLIQ
(Italian Quality Language Certification) quality system, which unites in one association the current certification bodies (University for Foreigners of Perugia, University for Foreigners of Siena, Rome Tre University and the Dante Alighieri Society) and University for Foreigners “Dante Alighieri” of Reggio Calabria, as well as in convention with Italian Institutes of Culture abroad or other institutions.
These certifications may be gained in the country of origin, in the approved exam centres found all over the world.
Applicants which do not hold any certificate of Italian language can participate in the test that is annually organized by the University. More information are available
here
Applicants participating in the “Marco Polo project* are required a certificate of Italian language proficiency at level B1.
EU applicants
are not required to have a certificate of Italian proficiency and do not have to pass any Italian language test. However, a good proficiency in Italian is highly recommended.
Other requirements
At least 1 reference(s) should be provided.

Overview
Presentation
The global warming and the consequent climatic changes have been mostly attributed to the emissions in the atmosphere of Greenhouse Gases (
GHG
s) deriving from anthropic activities such as combustion of fossil fuels, agricultural activities, and modifications of use of soils; waste dispersion in the environment; intensive use of non-sustainable industrial processes.
A judicious exploitation of Earth’s resources requires their sustainable management through the development and application of innovative biotechnological processes that guarantee a low environmental impact of human activities.
The progressive integration of agricultural and environmental policies makes necessary to train a new figure of Biotechnologist, capable of assessing the effects of climate change on the environment and on primary agricultural production and at the same time capable of setting new, economical, and industrial models for eco-sustainable agricultural and industrial activities.
Objectives
The Master Course “Biotechnology for environmental management and sustainable agriculture (
BIO
-
EMSA
)” aims at training Biotechnologists capable of understanding the complex processes related to climate change and capable of managing and developing ecologically sustainable agricultural and industrial processes.
For training this new professional figure, a multidisciplinary training path has been designed, which comprises a significant number of laboratory activities.
In particular, the Master Course
BIO
-
EMSA
will provide students with the technical and scientific skills needed for:
• interpreting, at molecular and cellular scale, the effects of climate change on biological systems, particularly those of agricultural and forestry interest,
• developing and managing eco-compatible and sustainable farming activities aimed at crop and livestock production,
• designing and developing new biotechnological products and processes by means of eco-compatible bioprocesses.
Career opportunities
Agricultural enterprises interested in developing eco-sustainable crop and livestock productions.
Biotechnology companies operating in the production of bioenergy and biomolecules by means of low environmental impact bioprocesses.
Biotechnology companies operating in eco-sustainable waste management and nutrient recycling.
Companies involved in the treatment and recovery of degraded or polluted environments.
European Agencies and National Authorities responsible for drawing up regulations for the eco-sustainable management of crop and livestock production and regulations for patenting biotechnological products and processes.
Universities and research institutes operating in the fields of environmental and agricultural biotechnology.
Public and private laboratories operating in the environmental control.
Italian, European and International Agencies, and
NGO
s working in the field of the environmental protection.
Graduates in the Master Course
BIO

EMSA
can apply for participating in the state examinations for accessing the Professional Directory of Doctors in Agronomy and Forestry (Albo degli Agronomi e Forestali), and for accessing the Professional Directory of Doctors in Biology (Albo dei Biologi).
