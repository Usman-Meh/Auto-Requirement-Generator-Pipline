Overview
The Master Program in Design of Sustainable Tourism Systems
The two years Master Program (second level degree) aims to provide a thorough understanding, at the university master level, of the contemporary techniques of organization and management of tourism activities. The Master Program is characterized by an interisciplinary program.
The graduates will acquire the basic competence in the fields of human and social sciences, a good command of information technology and of statistical techniques, indispensable for a real-world interpretation of tourism trends and of taste changes of the tourist population. The Master Program also provides legislative, historical and geographical knowledge useful for enhancing the values of the resources and the cultural heritage of a territory.
The Master Program deals with topics related with the sustainable management of natural, cultural and historical resources. The remarkable growth of tourism requires considerable planning activities by both the public and private sectors in order to maximise economic returns while containing the potential negative impacts on the environment.
