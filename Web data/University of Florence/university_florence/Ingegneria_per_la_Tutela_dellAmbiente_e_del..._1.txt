Overview
The master of science degree in Environmental Engineering is aimed to complete the academic
preparation of the graduate in Civil and Environmental Engineering and related courses. The Master of Science target is to train high qualified professional figures that combine an advanced knowledge of general methods and technical contents of Environmental Engineering and high numerical and analytical modeling abilities.
The course deepens also economic, regulatory and legislative aspects of specific sectors in order to develop both the technical/cultural growth with the ability of taking responsibility.
The course has agreements aimed to the recognition of the title in both universities (or double title) with the Ss Cyril and Methodius University (
UKIM
) in Skopje, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (
FYROM
), the Novi Sad University of Serbia and the Politechnic University of Tirana of Albania, respectively on shared educational paths of Environmental and resources engineering, Environmental Protection Engineering and Geoenvironmental Engineering study courses.
The degree course has also obtained the international accreditation
EUR
-
ACE
and participates in the quality certification of Engineering degree courses.
Programme structure
This is a two-years master programme and provides for two curricula named “Technologies and Plants for the Environment” and “Sustainable Management of Natural Resources”.
The first year provides for all the mandatory training activities through which the knowledge of mathematical and numerical modeling, the analysis and economic evaluation of hydraulics and processes and technologies for the recovery of materials from waste flows are deepened.
The students of the curriculum “Technologies and Plants for the Environment” complete the first year with training activities that aim to extent the chemical knowledge and the acquisition of skills on management and maintenance of plants.
The student of the curriculum “Sustainable Management of Natural Resources”, instead, complete the first year with training activities about environmental geology, remote sensing and
GIS
.
The training of the two professional figures is completed during the second year with courses focused on the acquisition of specific skills.
In the curriculum “Technologies and Plants for the Environment” the technical interventions and the plants aimed to protect the environment  and human health are deepened.
Instead in the curriculum “Sustainable Management of Natural Resources”, the training activities are aimed to give the specific skills and the sustainable use of water, energy and territory.
In the second year are, moreover, located the free choice activities for the student. Regarding the final project work and the internship students are free to choose where to develop his activity (companies, public offices, counseling and professional offices and engineering society).
The methods and teaching tools to achieve the target are lectures and classroom exercises, lab activities that combine direct training with front-assisted practical applications (simulative, planning, instrumental and experimental) and technical visits.
Career opportunities
The training of the master graduate in Environmental Engineering is also designed for a lifelong learning and further specialization in specific or scientifically advanced sectors, with the continuation of the studies in higher education such as Master in the environmental sector or Phd.
The master graduate is able to work in European wide companies operating in the large building sector or specialized  in monitoring interventions, pollution removal, waste disposal and provision of services.
