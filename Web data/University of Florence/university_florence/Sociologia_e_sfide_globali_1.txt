Overview
Social change dynamics are set in a context of growing social and cultural interdependencies on a global scale that question traditional and conventional methods of analytical and critical interpretation. All this requires the development of new tools and new theoretical, methodological and professional skills; but also of innovative approaches to teaching and to the learning process.
The Master’s Degree in Sociology and Global Challenges addresses the study of the challenges and opportunities of contemporary societies and provides innovative theoretical-methodological tools through a balanced combination of interdisciplinary knowledge and skills that allow Sociology to communicate with Political Philosophy, Political Science, Demography, Social Geography, Contemporary History.
