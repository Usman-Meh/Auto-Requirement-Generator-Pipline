PERSONAL
PREPARATION
REQUIREMENTS
:
For EU citizens and, in any case, for those who have obtained the degree required for access to the master’s degree in an institution located in the countries of the European Union (as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Republic of San Marino, Vatican City, Great Britain), the adequacy of personal preparation is verified through a written and/or oral test with the Commission.
For those who have obtained the degree required for access to the master’s degree at an institution that is not located in the countries of the European Union (or in Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Republic of San Marino, Vatican City, Great Britain), preparation will be evaluated based on the weighted average of examination grades or, if not available, on the undergraduate grade, which must be above a threshold value. These values will be published annually at
www.ing.mme.unifi.it/vp-160-enrollment.html
The entry qualification documents are accepted in the following languages: English / French / Italian / Spanish.
Often you can get a suitable transcript from your school. If this is not the case, you will need official translations along with verified copies of the original.

Overview
The International Master Degree Program in Management Engineering is a 2-year course entirely
taught in English. The program description and practical info are available in this student guide, which is intended for use by the students enrolled in the academic year 2023-24. Students enrolled in previous years, should refer to the corresponding student guides available on the School’s website www.ingegneria.unifi.it Application can be submitted according to the procedure outlined in the Master Degree website.
The International Master Degree Program in Management Engineering trains high-level professionals mastering statistical, analytical, and numerical methods and with strong technical-scientific, economic, and organizational skills.
The breadth of topics covered and the level of depth that characterizes the teaching activities, provide graduates with a high technical and cultural preparation that qualifies them to fill multiple roles in large and medium-sized companies, as well as in small companies where they can quickly reach managerial positions.
In fact, the educational activities are designed to prepare professionals who can drive change processes such as the digital transformation of the manufacturing industry, contribute to the adoption of new cutting-edge manufacturing solutions and systems, and assist in the development of new business models.
The management engineer trained at the University of Florence has a predominantly industrial
orientation but can also work in service enterprises.
All the mandatory courses are taught in English. The use of English by faculty and students in teaching activities fosters the development of vocabulary that will enable master’s degree graduates to operate in the context of the global economy, as required by the companies in which they typically find employment.
Programme structure
The course of study is organized into two curricula. The first called “Smart Industry” is based entirely on courses provided at the University of Florence. The second one called “International,” is based on a structured international mobility agreement signed with
HSLU
Lucerne and includes a year of study abroad (the second one) and the award of a double engineering degree, the Italian and the Swiss one.
Access to the international curriculum requires participation in a special call for applications.
The two curricula overlap the first year.
For both curricula, the mandatory courses are almost all in the areas of operations management,
industrial plant engineering, design and management of production processes and production systems, automation, as well as business economics and organization, innovation, and project management. In the first year, basic knowledge is also enhanced by delving into operations research and statistics for experiments and forecasting.
The second year differentiates the two curricula.
In the
Smart Industry
curriculum, this includes, in addition to some courses in the above-mentioned areas, a stage/traineeship activity, and the writing of a thesis. The thesis should be based on an industrial project and/or research activity and have characteristics of originality.
In the
International
curriculum, on the other hand, the second year features courses to be selected from
HSLU
Lucerne’s course offerings, a specialization project, and a co-tutored thesis activity supervised by two faculty members from each of the two universities. Teaching activities are planned in a blended mode up to a maximum of 1/3 of the
ECTS
and may involve innovative teaching methods such as the “flipped classroom”.
Career opportunities
The professional roles trained are the following:
RM1: Designer and manager of traditional and advanced manufacturing systems
Professional who takes technical and economic decisions relevant to the setup of production capacity and, in the production phase, to the efficient management of the factors of production.

It integrates the various factors with systems engineering methodologies from a system life cycle perspective.
RM2: Innovation manager
Professional who supports – working directly with entrepreneurs, general managers, country managers – the identification of new business opportunities (blue ocean), using innovative approaches to explore and ideate new solutions (design thinking, user-centered design, lean canvas, business model canvas).
RM3: Service manager

He/she places special emphasis on time, cost, quality, and risk control, operates in many different contexts, and can be the subject of specific professional qualifications.
RM5: Operations and supply chain manager
Professional who analyzes, plans, schedules, and controls production and supply chain following the paradigms of agile and lean production. He/she streamlines and simplifies production by identifying waste and detecting its root causes and best integrates production needs with those of maintenance, safety, quality, energy efficiency, and environmental impact reduction. In addition, he/she implements mechanisms for coordination and integration among the various actors of the supply chain.
RM6: Reliability, maintenance, and safety engineer
Professional with the skills for measuring, assessing, managing, and improving
RAMS
(Reliability,
Availability, Maintainability, and Safety) performance of components, systems, processes, plants and facilities. He/she is familiar with diagnostic methodologies aimed at optimizing maintenance activities;selects maintenance policies by minimizing expected cost, optimally manages spare parts inventory, performs risk and functional safety assessments, and identifies solutions for prevention and impact minimization.
