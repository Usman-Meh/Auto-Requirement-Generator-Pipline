Why Choose Jewish Studies?
Explore the history and impact of Jewish culture
From their origin as a small Middle Eastern tribe to their present-day diaspora throughout the world, people of Jewish faith and heritage — from Jesus, Spinoza, and Marc Chagall to Albert Einstein, Betty Friedan, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg — have left an indelible mark on almost every aspect of human endeavor, and their struggles are as historic as those accomplishments.
As a student in the Jewish studies concentration
, you’ll explore the major historical and religious trends in Jewish civilization since its inception in antiquity. You’ll also become familiar with a broad range of developments both encountered and fostered by the Jewish people: their contact with other world civilizations, classical literature, social and religious institutions, and interaction with the modern world. In this concentration, Jews and Judaism are studied both in their own internal context and as paradigms for wider trends in history and religion.
While you can combine this concentration with any major, it’s an especially good complement to majors in ancient civilization, combined languages, comparative literature, history, philosophy, and sociology.
Minimum number of courses to complete this concentration: 7
