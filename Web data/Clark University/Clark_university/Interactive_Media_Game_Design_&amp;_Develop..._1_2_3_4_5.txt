Turn your passion for gaming into an exciting career.
You may have started gaming for the fun of it — to compete in ways that you can’t in the real world, to make new friends, and to explore crazy, new, virtual worlds. But video games are not just for entertainment. The same technology and design process that goes into making games is found in simulations used for education and training, and the apps people use for crypto currency, global translation,
drone-
assisted rescue missions, and self-driving vehicles.
The
Bachelor of Arts in Interactive Media: Game Design and Development — with tracks in 3D Art, 2D Art, Audio, Programming, Production, Writing, UI/UX, or Design Your Own — is a groundbreaking, nationally ranked interactive media and game design program that will allow you to pursue your passion for games while preparing you for a career in the $1
6
0 billion interactive media and gaming industry.
