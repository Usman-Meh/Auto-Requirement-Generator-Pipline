Why Study Computational Science?
Apply the power of computation to scientific research
There are times when scientific experiments are too expensive, insufficiently accurate, or require conditions impossible to achieve in a laboratory setting. Fortunately, computers — cheap, powerful, and accurate — can often be used to simulate the required experimental conditions, while computations based on accurate mathematical models can inform scientists on how to set up an experiment to achieve a viable outcome.
As a student in the computational science concentration
, you’ll be introduced to computational tools and techniques — numerical methods, models, and algorithms — and learn how these nontraditional approaches can answer questions in the sciences, perhaps even those in your own major.
While this concentration is especially appropriate for students majoring in the sciences, mathematics, or computer science, students in other majors will be considered on an individual basis.
Minimum number of courses to complete this concentration: 10
Requirements and courses
Hands-On Learning
As a complement to this concentration, you can engage in a variety of related experiential learning opportunities, including internships, study abroad, and research.
Careers
A foundation in computational science is an asset to those seeking careers in such fields as the natural sciences, computer science, engineering, actuarial science, or statistical analysis.
