Why Choose German Studies?
Immerse yourself in one of Europe’s oldest and most influential cultures
From science and technology (think Einstein and Gutenberg) to psychology, philosophy, and the arts (Freud, Hannah Arendt, Mozart, and Marlene Dietrich) the achievements of German-speaking peoples have played a critical role in European and world history, from their first contact with the Roman Empire to the present.
As a student in the German studies concentration
