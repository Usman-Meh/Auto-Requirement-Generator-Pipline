“The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”
—
William Faulkner
As a history major, you will uncover insights and perspectives from the past to better understand the present. Through working directly with artifacts of the past — from letters exchanged during the Holocaust to the genealogical records of a local African-American community — history will come alive in your hands.
You will collaborate with professors and peers to develop a deep understanding of the past across eras, cultures, and societies. At the same time, you will master critical skills — persuasive writing, interpreting data, and giving compelling presentations, among others — that will prepare you for a successful career in any field. Our graduates have worked in education, libraries, museums, business, medicine, law, social justice, and the military.

Your faculty adviser will work with you to design a history program that fits your interests and goals. All history majors are required to take ten history courses, along with two related non-history courses, distributed as follows:

One course each in United States, European, and global history
One course devoted primarily to the period before 1800
Five courses in your chosen area of specialization, which may be a geographic specialization in U.S., European, or global History, or a thematic specialization that is comparative or transnational in its approach
A senior-year capstone course, designed to bring together all you have learned in your specialization; this requirement can also be fulfilled by entering the honors program and writing a thesis
Two courses outside the History Department in fields related to your area of specialization
