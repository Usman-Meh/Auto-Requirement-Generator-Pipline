Art is the signature of civilizations.
When you study the history of art, you study the history of power, identity, and culture in human societies across the globe. Leading to a bachelor of arts degree, the art history major looks at creative works in context, tracing the human experience throughout the ages in relation to the visual art, sculpture, and architecture of a given time. Whether considering ancient Islamic tiles or the work of contemporary Worcester artists, you’ll gain insight into art’s ability to reflect and resonate with social and cultural beliefs and events.
Your understanding will also consider the technologies of art-making and the ways the visual arts shape broader conversations about our culture and what it means to be human. By conducting research with faculty, curating exhibits, or participating in the digital reconstruction of an ancient temple, you’ll bring your classroom learning to bear in hands-on activities that will prepare you for an exciting career.

Careers / Graduate Study
As an art history major, you’ll complete at least 11 courses — ten in art history and one in studio art. The program offers courses in ancient, Renaissance/Baroque, modern, and non-Western art. You should plan to take at least one course in non-Western art, and at least two courses in each of the other areas. All students take three core courses:
From the Stone Age to Our Age: Monuments and Masterpieces of Western Art
Art, the Public, and the History of Worcester (a Problems of Practice course)
The Art of Art History: Teaching and Methods (senior capstone)
As part of the senior-year capstone course, you’ll lead a semester-long weekly discussion section for the introductory course From the Stone Age to Our Age, an opportunity that allows you to share your enthusiasm for and knowledge of art.
Like many art history majors at Clark, you might choose to complete a second major; e.g., studio art, history, philosophy, or geography. Requirements for the major are slightly different if you double-major.
Skills You Learn
Skills you will learn include:
How to visually analyze a work of art
How to write and speak coherently and persuasively

Building your foundation
The Clark Experience
The Clark Core allows students to take courses across diverse disciplines, helping them develop critical thinking skills and respect for other cultures and perspectives. You’ll connect classroom learning with action through world and workplace experiences.
Learn More
At Clark, your education extends beyond the classroom. Visit the
Career Connections Center
to learn more about
internship opportunities
that complement your coursework and put your art history knowledge into practice.
The art history major provides abundant opportunities for you to learn outside the classroom: you might assist in curating an exhibit at the
Worcester Art Museum
, lean about book and paper conservation in Clark’s
Archives and Special Collections Department
, study sculpture at the
Museum of Fine Arts
in Boston, or analyze the modern architecture and design of
Walter Gropius’
house in Lincoln. Every student in our major takes our Problems of Practice seminar and contributes to a work of public scholarship that serves the mission of a local arts organization. In recent years, students have contributed gallery materials for
ArtsWorcester
and have recorded episodes of the podcast
WAMxUniversity
for the Worcester Art Museum.
Many students take advantage of
internship
opportunities during the academic year or over the summer to connect what they’re learning with professional development. See our list of local internship placements to the right. For many students, an internship is an excellent way to experience art history in a professional setting. Some students continue their internship work into paid positions after completing the B.A. at Clark.
You can also enroll in Gallery Practice and Culture, a Problems of Practice in Studio Art course that introduces students to gallery work while they intern at the
Schiltkamp Gallery
, Clark’s main exhibition space, located in the
Traina Center for the Arts
. Students help plan, install and dismantle exhibits. If exhibit artists live locally, you might have an opportunity to interact with them and visit their studios.
In the summer after your junior year, you might be eligible for the Sara Bickman Music and Arts Summer Internship for Undergraduates, which provides financial support for summer internships for undergraduates majoring in the Visual and Performing Arts.
Other opportunities include:
Study Abroad and Away
Participation in a Study Abroad and Away program is an opportunity to gain world and workplace experience that complements your coursework. Clark approves semester, year-long, and summer opportunities to earn credit through academic coursework, internships, community-based learning, or research.  Explore our
Study Abroad and Away
website where you can search programs by academic interest,
location
, and language. After you’ve identified some appropriate programs, ensure they fit into your four-year plan by talking with your faculty adviser as early as possible.
