Why Choose Africana Studies?
In and Out of Africa
From before recorded history to the present, diverse peoples of African descent — think writer Toni Morrison, President Barack Obama, and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson — have journeyed to places around the world, carrying with them cultural traditions and perspectives that have profoundly affected those they have encountered along the way.
As a student in the Africana studies concentration
, you’ll explore the lives of people of African ancestry both in Africa and around the world, with a special focus on sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States. In the process, you’ll develop a cultural, historical, political, social, and geographical awareness of the ways people of African descent have lived, worked, created, and fought for self-definition and self-determination.
Africana studies is one of seven undergraduate programs affiliated with Clark’s
Center for Gender, Race, and Area Studies
, a community of faculty and students from a wide range of disciplines who study diverse, disadvantaged, or marginalized societies and populations, with an emphasis on promoting social justice.
While you can combine this concentration with any major, it’s an especially good complement to majors like community, youth, and education studies; French; geography; history; international development and social change; political science; sociology; and women’s and gender studies.
Minimum number of courses needed to complete this concentration: 6
