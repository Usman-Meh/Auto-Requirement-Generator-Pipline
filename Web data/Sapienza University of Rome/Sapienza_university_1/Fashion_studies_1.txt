Studying fashion in Rome means experiencing a city that is “open” to Italian fashion and its development, from haute couture to the artisan values of Made in Italy which are famous all around the world.
It means having the opportunity to integrate knowledge of fashion production with the world of entertainment, film and theater, in an unique artistic and cultural context.
Therefore, it involves getting in touch with
neocouture
and the new languages that blend art, fashion and culture with traditions and innovation.
