The word Psychology comes from the Greek words ψυχή (soul) and λόγος (study of), representing so a discipline that investigates the psychic processes. In time, the idea of "soul" was progressively replaced with the idea of "mind," but this has not absolutely reduced the various ways in which the "mind/psyche" can appear to our eyes. This means that there are a number of areas of "mind" that can be subject of reflection and research: the unconscious... the social interactions... the cognitive processes... the development... the neural processes... etc.
