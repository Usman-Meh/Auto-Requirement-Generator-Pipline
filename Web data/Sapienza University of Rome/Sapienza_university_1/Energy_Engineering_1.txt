Thanks to the establishment of the first Study Programme in Engineering in Rome by Pope Pius VII in 1817, the first school for professional training in engineering was created in Italy to educate specialized technicians to work for the Water and Roads Bureau. In 1826 Pope Leo XII decided that  “technical studies” should also be part of the Archiginnasio of Sapienza University.
