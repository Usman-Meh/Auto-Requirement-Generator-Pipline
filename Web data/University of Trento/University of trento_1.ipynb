      "The degree course under business management represents a path aimed at ambitious students who, since imaging, want to acquire skills and management techniques suitable for dealing with the problems of companies of all sizes.\n",
      "With an approach that enhances the active training experience of the students, the training course combines disciplinary skills through a continuous reference to the company realities belonging to the various sectors (private, for profit, public administration and non -profit companies).The typical managerial skills (marketing, finance, organization of quality management, control ...) are made available both in specialist courses and in the workshops where the problem-based approach is the main learning mode.The degree course favors international experiences, including internships, in the context of the university networks to which the Department participates.\n",
      "Content and training objectives\n",
      "The topics treated include both the foundations of management - (accounting analysis and corporate finance, business strategies, marketing strategies, organization, logistics etc.) - both advanced and avant -garde issues for companies of the future, such as environmental sustainabilityand the corporate social role.Some qualifying themes include: the business-medium interaction, the behavior of employees and consumers, the actions for the radical change of organizational and strategic type, the family nature of businesses, managerial decisions.\n",
      "The basic elements for understanding the economic and macroeconomic dynamics that involve companies, as well as fundamental knowledge of law, will also be provided.\n",
      "Methodological approach\n",
      "The degree course intends to develop both managerial skills, and the training of the student in its entirety, as a human person, capable of critical analysis and autonomous and independent judgment.\n",
      "To this end, he intends to be based on the active participation of the student and on the interactions and the exchanges of ideas, in addition to the individual study.\n",
      "The training course combines a solid conceptual and methodological knowledge with practical applications, making the concrete reality of companies constantly refer to its qualifying element.\n",
      "This objective is achieved through the alternation of specialist courses for the development of managerial skills and application workshops based on a problem-based approach of the application type.In addition, the individual specialist courses employ-according to the specific didactic purposes-a plurality of methods, such as group works, analysis and discussion of corporate cases, group presentations in the classroom, qualitative and qualitative analysis.\n",
      "The training course is completed with a training experience at companies (internship), which expands and consolidates the knowledge acquired during university training.\n",
      "Temporary study periods in other universities or abroad (Exchange Program), as well as further internship experiences in addition to the internship, are encouraged.\n",
      "Pre-foundations\n",
      "The course is open to students of various origins and does not require specific knowledge or prerequisites.\n",
      "The main contents will be processed by the foundations, offering the possibility of learning the management disciplines even to those who, in previous training, have not had the opportunity to approach the functioning of the companies.\n",
      "Output routes\n",
      "The three -year course under business management predisposes - with the fundamental courses already scheduled for program - for access to all the master's degrees of the Department of Economics and Management of the University of Trento, as well as other Italian and foreign universities.Access to these advanced training courses can already be carried out at the end of the three -year course or, by choice of the student, downstream of a training experience in the company to be carried out at the end of the course.\n",
