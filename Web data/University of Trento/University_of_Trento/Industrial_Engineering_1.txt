Course structure
In the 1st year a common program is planned where the basic teachings are deepened: mathematics, chemistry, physics, IT
From the 2nd year the study of characterizing disciplines (materials, metallurgy, mechanics, electronics, programming) has been introduced and starting from the second half of the semester you can choose a sector of industrial engineering deepen according to your interests and perfect during the 3rd year.
You can choose between 3 innovative curricula, designed to prepare graduates for the demands of the job market in a sector in constant evolution.
Materials for the sustainable industry: it deepens the study of traditional and innovative materials, the life cycle of products, transformation technologies and production processes with a view to sustainability.It provides basic information skills of information engineering to make it clear the potential offered by IT technologies and their impact in productive realities.
Robotics and mechatronics: it is aimed at the formation of engineers oriented to the new generation manufacturing industry.It focuses on the study of subsystems of different nature, such as mechanical, electrical, electronic and IT those, reaching the main specificities of information engineering.Particular emphasis is given to mechatronic systems, robotics and intelligent machines.
Management: provides the basic knowledge useful for industrial engineers to interpret the challenges of the organization and business management of the latest generation production plants.The preparation mainly focuses on the techniques and management technologies and on the control of complex industrial plants, with a look aimed at the evolution of the future.
