Training objectives
The course intends to provide graduates with the tools necessary to create an integrated cognitive approach to biological systems.This term indicates an approach aimed at studying all the molecular components, biological/physiological parameters and their interactions in complex systems.
For the purposes indicated, the course includes training activities that allow:
to acquire in -depth knowledge of the basic genetic mechanisms of the cell and their regulation;
to acquire in-depth knowledge of the structural components of the cell, their role in maintaining cellular integrity, cell communication and in the regulation of the metabolism;- to know and understand the technologies used for genetic manipulation;
to acquire adequate skills of chemistry and physics, in particular to integrate the scientific foundations of the analysis methodologies that characterize biomolecular technologies;
to acquire adequate mathematics and computer skills, in particular those aimed at analyzing data;
to know how to use all the information deriving from modern biotechnological platforms and to apply it in concrete situations to analyze and understand biological phenomena;
to acquire adequate knowledge of legal and deontological regulations and bioethic problems.
Professional profiles
The degree course in Biomolecular Sciences and Technologies prepares for the professions of:
Specialists in life sciences, in particular biologists, biochemicals, food biotechnologists and microbiologists;
researchers and technicians graduated in biological sciences.
Studies that can be taken after graduation
