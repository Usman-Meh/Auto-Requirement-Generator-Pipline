Training objectives
The graduate/The graduate in Physics of Trento:
It has a solid preparation in the disciplines included in the areas of mathematical and IT disciplines and chemical disciplines, with particular reference to mathematics;
It is able to privilege the general and basic aspects of the disciplines included in the experimental and application areas, theoretical and the foundations of physics and microfisic and the structure of the subject of the characterizing activities indicated in the table of the training activities of this system, and in particular of thestructure of the matter up to the nuclear and subnuclear level;
has a solid type of preparation
experimental
achieved through the offer of advanced 'educational laboratory' structures;
is familiar with the s
theoretical-mathematical, technological-sensitive and also computer-computational truments
relating to individual disciplines;
is able to integrate the tools referred to in the previous point;
it is able to carry out, directly or after a short internship, work activities that require a certain familiarity with
innovative technologies
;
it is able to develop and analyze
models for complex systems
with applications in the industrial, financial or services in which they were requested;
It is able to profit with any specialization within a master's degree course in the physics class.
The course is structured in a single path.
Professional profiles
The graduate in Physics of Trento will be able to:
carry out activities that require the application of physics in
Technological and research and development sectors
(including electronics, optics, IT, acoustic, mechanics);
cover technical roles in activity of
laboratory
and services relating to radioprotection, environmental control and safety, development and characterization of materials, telecommunications, remote controls of satellite systems;
operate in contexts that require the ability to apply the scientific method to solve problems, the processing of models, to the
data collection and their analysis
.
The graduate in Physics of Trento, in carrying out the aforementioned tasks, will have the opportunity to exercise the analysis capacity e
Modeling of complex phenomena with scientific methodology, problem solving ability, the management capacity of technologically advanced equipment.
Among the main areas employment, they indicate:
the continuation of 2nd level studies in physics or other scientific disciplines;
The industry, with particular reference to the sectors of electronics, information technology and energy;
The advanced tertiary sector, in particular in the areas that require the development of quantitative models for the analysis of complex systems and the analysis of data, such as the economic and/or environmental scope.
Regarding Istat codes, the course prepares for the profession of:
Physical and nuclear technicians - (3.1.1.1.2)
The course also allows you to obtain the qualification to the profession of graduate industrial expert
Studies that can be taken after graduation
The preparation acquired with a degree in physics can continue with the achievement of the master's degree in physics (class LM-17 of the master's degrees in physics).
