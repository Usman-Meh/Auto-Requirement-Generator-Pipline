The course intends to provide students with a solid humanistic training centered on both literary and linguistic-philological and historical studies on those of a historical nature, investigated in their correlations.
The study of literary texts, sources and documents is therefore placed in a picture attentive to the history of civilization from classical to contemporary age.The integration of the methods of classical, Italian, philological and historical studies leads to a large, organic and not fragmented cultural preparation.
In light of their interests and inclinations, students can develop their study plan by referring to three careers who face humanistic knowledge with a traditional modernly rethought approach:
Classic letters
,
Modern letters
,
History
.However, they can also opt for a
Free study plan
(individualized) which must be assessed and approved by the coordinator of the didactic field, in line with the Educational Regulations of the course.
Students are constantly stimulated to critical reflection and active participation not only during classroom lessons but also through numerous initiatives and collateral activities:
seminars
,
conferences
,
congresses
.In addition, conventions with foreign universities allow students to spend
A semester abroad
To refine their linguistic knowledge and, above all, to have an experience that is often crucial for their future life.
