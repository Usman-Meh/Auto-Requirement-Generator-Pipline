The master's degree in historical sciences is aimed at studying all forms of memory, in the continuous interrelation between the historical disciplines proper and those sciences (once called 'auxiliary') that deal with their understanding.It therefore aims to provide a high qualification about the methods of creation and conservation of memory: to know how it used and how it is used to pass on the memory of events and opinions, and distinguish within what has come between reality, fiction andcommonplace.We therefore learn to exercise a criticism which, albeit more specialized, is nothing more than the attitude that should guide every conscious citizen towards structures of power and the mechanisms of information.
